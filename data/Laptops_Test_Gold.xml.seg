Excellent product. Nice feel and fits exactly. Its a little confusing to put on though. However the seller has a video on youtube to guide you. The link is in the receipt. **** I highly recommend watching the video and following the instructions****. I would not have been able to figure out how to put this on without watching the video. Use a credit card or similar-$T$d cardboard piece to drive out bubbles as you put the screen in.  Managed to put it on with only a tiny corner bubble.It does take patience and skill to make sure you put this without bubbles.  If you do get one (as I did, or it is slightly misaligned as I did too) you can pull back the sheet halfway and start again.  Of course, once it is on, you cannot pull it back i imagine.  People who are complaining about bubbles either did not watch the video or were not patient/skillful.  I imagine that would be a problem with any other screen as well.The plastic has a nice sheen to it.  It feels smooth on the fingers.  I prefer this feel to the original cover.  It does tend to smudge a little, but somehow the smudges are not visible when the phone is in use (the light seems to hide them).  All in all, this is a much better cover than the original that comes with the phone.

Don't know what the $T$ difference between the 1st gen and 3g is but I'm currently using it on iphone 3g. It may be a few millimeters short but if you use one of those rubber cases in addition to the screen protector it is just perfect.

First of all, I have added an image that you can use to judge the $T$ of the protector on an iPhone 3G. I know it's hard to see a clear protector in a small photo, but in the image my iPhone is inthis case, which perfectly covers the edges of the screen protector on all sides, so there's no chance of pulling up the corners or getting dust, etc. around the edges of the protector.  There's a cut out semi-circle for the Home button.The protector itself is much sturdier than screen protectors you may have used in the past (for an iPod or Palm, for example). It's not the flimsy, flexible stuff.  For example, if a standard screen protector that you'd get at a big box store was the equivalent flexibility of a sheet of notebook paper, then this one would be the equivalent of a business card.The upshot of this is that you don't have to worry about corners folding or bubbles forming during application. You can position it very precisely before applying, and then when you apply, you get a PERFECT result, straight with no bubbles whatsoever.The fact that it's covered on both sides is very nice, so if you feel like it (though it's not really necessary because of its stiffness), you can use a credit card to press it down as you apply the protector without scratching the protector surface with the card.  To be honest though, it doesn't seem to scratch that easy anyway.  It's FAR less prone to scratches than any other screen protector I have ever used.So you get a high quality, crystal clear, bubble-free, scratch resistant protector that will easily outlast a normal screen protector, and will probably outlast a PACK of normal screen protectors.  And you basically get it for the cost of shipping.It's a no-brainer. Get it and thank me later. :-)UPDATE 10/10/2008:  Apparently the seller is no longer selling the 3G version here.  My review applied to the 3G version that was being sold on this page at the time the review was submitted.  I'm sure that the review of the material, etc. still applies though.

This would be fine if it fit right.  They made the width of this EXACTLY this same with as the screen $T$ for the iPhone.  The problem is that if you are one nanometer off to either side during the application, the whole thing is blown and you have to throw it away.  Trust me, you will be off by at least a nanometer and your screen protector will be sitting up on the outside frame of the phone on one side leaving bubbles underneath.  This could have been better produced.  Try another one.

The film works great. To put it on WITHOUT any bubbles, you put the film on the phone slowly, starting on one side of the phone and working toward the other,use your finger to slowly push out any bubbles as they form. You must also make sure your phone glass is clean and dust free. It might take you a try or two. The film is also very close to the actual $T$ of the actual iphone glass, so it must be applied straight and true to the glass or it will overlap and need to be re applied.It isnt hard, it just takes a little attention. This film works just as good as the ones priced for $15 at the apple store for a fraction of that price.

When I opened the shipping envelope I got worried because the packaging looks incredibly cheap, like you'd pick up this item from a cell phone store in Chinatown that stocks products no RadioShack or Best Buy would even consider selling. The screen itself is slightly over$T$d, so you're bound to have air bubbles trapped on one side or the other. The product package claims there is a "provided installation card" that should help smooth out the bubbles. No such card was provided. It took several attempts to get the screen to look decent, but several attempts means fingerprints and dust inevitably make their way to the underside of the screen, making them difficult to remove. I felt ripped off by this product.

I tested the three on my T-mobile G1, but this review applies to all makes and models since they use the same $T$ but just cut to different sizes to fit the phone.ZAGG invisibleSHIELD+ Extremely durable and scratch resistant+ I took a key trying to drive a hole through one of these sheets and was not able to+ If you screw up putting the screen on, it's fairly easy to remove w/out creasing the screen- A huge pain to put on, especially if you have to fit the skin around round contours- If you have a dark color phone, the body protector would make your phone look shiny looking cheap- Deal breaker for me: If you have a touch screen, the screen protector gave some resistance when finger swiping (scrolling down web pages) and dragging your finger along the screen. It had a rubber-ish feeling.Boxwave crystal+ Like the name says, crystal clear+ Fairly easy to put on- If you screw up putting the sheet on the first time (E.g. misaligned or a particle was caught beneath the sheet), it was difficult to peel the sheet off w/out creating a permanent fold/crease- Deal breaker for me: Although there was not  much resistance as the invisibleSHIELD (it did not have the rubber-ish feeling), there was still some resistance. After a couple uses w/ enough face/finger oils the resistance was gone. However, since I screwed up the first time putting it on which resulted in creasing the protective sheet while peeling it off, it gave me the opportunity to try out the Boxwave Anti-glare.Boxwave anti-glare+ Comparing to the Boxwave crystal, I was not able to tell the difference in visibility. I would say it was equally crystal clear.+ Easy to put on, now that I had practice from my screwup w/ the Boxwave Crystal+ Anti-glare as advertised- If you screw up, you've screwed up - as mentioned as a -'ve for the Boxwave Crystal as well+ The major deal winner: Least resistance. Comparing to the previous two, I'm extremely happy w/ the feel of this screen protector when swiping back and forth. I recommend this screen protector not only for protecting the screen of your phone, but also to make any screen easier to swipe. I'm not sure why Boxwave didn't include this feel for the Boxwave Crystal line, but this was definitely the selling point for me.hth,

Love this thing. When I felt how thick it was I thought it would make it very difficult to $T$ the phone. I was wrong. In fact, when I first got this phone (coming from a blackberry) the touchscreen was too sensitive. This actually made it easier to $T$. I'm horrible to my phones and I know this has paid for itself 30 times over already. I can tell by the feel it was designed for hard core phone ab$T$rs like me.

So, I bought 3 of these screen protectors. Two for the Nokia, and one for a samsung phone (one for me, one for my wife, and one for another family member). I was given the task of installing these on the phones, and since I did 3, I got some good practice, and learned some important lessons.Here's what you should know:1. Their "lint-free" cloth they provide isn't completely lint free. It left a little black thread link on my screen that ended up getting encased under the screen cover. It wouldn't be a huge deal, but it's right in the middle of my screen, so my eye is always drawn to it. It's not big, and it doesn't compromise the integrity of the cover, but it's distracting, and frustrating that the cloth that was supposed to get rid of that stuff actually ca$T$d it... that was phone number 1. Lesson learned. Don't trust the cloth alone to get rid of all lint... check check check check check, and then check again, to make sure there's no lint on your screen when you are going to put your protector on.2. Don't $T$ the squeegee they provide. It's just a little cutout of thin plastic that you're supposed to $T$ to push the liquid out, but the one's i received did not have smooth edges. They had rough edges that WILL scratch the screen protector. I didn't $T$ mine on phone #1, but on my wife's phone, I $T$d the squeegee, after trying to smooth out the rough plastic, and afterwards, I noticed tiny little scratches all over the protector where I had $T$d the squeegee. Don't $T$ it! Just push the liquid out with the cloth, or $T$ something else hard and flat that you know won't scratch it. That was phone number 2. Another lesson learned.3. Now it was time to install the protector on another family member's phone, and I $T$d my previous lessons to install hers. That one turned out almost perfect. Third time is the charm I guess!Overall, the product itself, the screen protector, is a good product. The installation accessories they provide, though, can actually ca$T$ problems or damage your protector. Since you only get one, it's not like you can just redo it after you install it, which is why I hope this post helps anyone interested in this product. I'm not saying don't buy it... I'm just saying to $T$ my lessons to help you avoid having the same issues.

Its a little difficult to install. You have to wait 12-24 hours to $T$ your phone. Bubbles seemed to fade during this time though.

Once the TechSkin, is installed it works great.  The installation is a little tricky, but there are great instructions on YouTube and included with the product.  Once installed there were a lot of micro-bubbles between the skin and the phone screen, but I left it over night and by morning the bubbles were gone and the phone was ready for $T$.  Hint: I installed the skin in the bathroom after running the shower for a while.  The hope was that it would get the dust out of the air and from the results, it worked.  Also, $T$ a lot of the provided spray on your fingers to make sure you don't get fingerprints on the skin.  As you can tell, I liked the product and would buy again.

This offers a clear view of the screen and seems like it will be very protective.  It is a little more complicated to apply than I had anticipated, so it took me longer to actually attempt to $T$ it, but it wasn't too difficult.

I followed the instructions precisely in installing a Skinomi on my new Samsung Galaxy Blaze. A week after installing, I got an email from Skinomi suggesting I watch the installation video before reviewing. I watched it and didn't find anything that I had not found in the written instructions, except the suggestion to clean off the work surface with Windex or something before installing. I didn't do that, but the work surface was clean and I didn't get any hairs or dust onto the screen.  The installation went as described. The detergent solution is very effective in initially cleaning the surface, and in temporarily rendering the adhesive friction-free for easy placement. I made an error of perhaps a millimeter in aligning the bottom portion of the screen protector, but as the cover I bought wraps slightly around the front, this was no problem. (It is probably unlikely that you are going to get a picture perfect installation on your first try, but if you are careful it will be satisfactory.)My reason for only giving the product a 3 (I would give it 3.5 if that were available), is that the final result is not a glass-like surface. Ridges are visible running vertically along the whole length under certain light conditions. Possibly this was due to an imperfectly smooth credit card, the edge of which I $T$d for smoothing--but I don't think so. Having read other reviews I took considerable care to find the smoothest un$T$d card I had. I believe it is simply the nature of the product. Another imperfection is that you see moir&eacute; patterns if there is significant grease, such as from eating a sandwich, on the screen. This can occur with glass too, but the extra thickness of the screen allows for greater refraction of the light.All in all, I am happier having the protector than not. It is better than the cheap one I $T$d in the waiting period before this one arrived in the mail. It is just not so "ultra clear" as you might expect from the advertising. It is functional, and you can see through it without much distortion. But you know it's there. If I knew a better alternative I would $T$ that. But I don't.

The sticker's $T$ is alright, I am somewhat familiar with how to put on a screen protector without leaving many bubbles, so neither posed a problem for me. The deal breaker happened when I tried to remove the sticker that is pasted on the protector as a "handle" to peel it off the backing plastic. That sticker would not come off cleanly. In fact, that sticker would not come off at all. In the end, the sticker left half of itself on my screen protector, meaning I have to remove the protector and throw it away, otherwise I can't see the lower right corner of my phone. Verdict: absolutely useless.

I bought these screen protectors for my Droid X and found them to be absolute junk.They are difficult to apply without air bubbles, and the squeegee they supply scratches the protectors! Just taking the phone in and out of a pocket causes them to start peeling off.  They are not exactly the $T$ of the screen (about 1mm small on all four sides), and they do not allow for smooth swiping motions.I ended up going to the Verizon store to get their screen protectors which while more expensive are far superior in every way.Lesson learned: You get what you pay for!

These screen protectors seem great at first.  They go on easier than just about any other screen protector I've ever used, and they are perfectly $T$d.  But after a week or so they start shrinking and no longer cover the entire screen.  As each day passes, they shrink a little more and a little more.  I've gone through four of them now, all with the same outcome.  And even though they are static cling, they still leave a residue on the screen after removing them that can be tough to completely remove.

I have a hate/hate relationship with screen protectors. No matter how easy the company says they are, no matter how wonderful they claim to be, they have bubbles. That is right, bubbles.So when this arrived unannounced in the mail, I nearly threw them in the trash. I don't DO screen protectors. But since they sent the correct $T$ for my 5S, I figured the worst I could do is spend a couple of minutes putting one on. Imagine my shock - NOT A SINGLE BUBBLE!So I went to test number 2 - how does it work - will my phone still recognize my finger as easily? Yep, not even the tiniest hesitation. Instead of peeling it off (like I intended to do after the test), I left it on.A couple of notes. Generiks sells fingerprint-free film. This isn't it. It does collect prints. But it does protect the surface of my iPhone.I took off a star because it doesn't fully fit side to side, almost, just not quite! EDITED - See company comment below. There is a purpose for it not fitting side to side - it is to make sure that covers fit correctly. :-)

I ordered for my iPhone 5. Definitely not anti-glare.  The cover looks cheap with one over$T$d hole around all sensors, etc on top instead of individual holes. And the bottom below the home button is open. Why skimp out on a tiny bit more plastic? I guess you get what you pay for. Otherwise it works fine as a screen protector, but I'll skip it next time for something with actual anti-glare and better protection. Shipping took longer than expected as well.

This purchase was nothing but a waste of time and money.  The screen protector is cut too short and does not have the appropriate cutouts for the button.  Or if you raise it up, it does not have cut outs for the speaker.  Either way, it is about 2/3rds the length it should be. It is also too wide on the sides.  Additionally, even when carefully following instructions, the protector bubbles horribly and is hazy.  While the haze could fade in a few days, I did not keep the screen protector on long enough to find out, because it was just too terribly $T$d to be tolerable.

I was excited to see such a good deal on iPhone 5 covers so soon after the phone launch. Furthermore, it carried a very respectable average rating on Amazon so I ordered without hesitation. Unfortunately, the product I received was terrible.The outer package was exactly as pictured on the item page. It was even labeled as iPhone 5 screen protector 3-pack. What was inside the package was entirely the wrong thing, however. There were three screen protectors, but they were the wrong $T$. The width and rounded corners fit the phone well, however there were no cutouts for the speaker, camera, light sensor, or home button. Even if there were a home button cutout, the cover was not long enough to reach the button.I don't know what I was shipped, but it wasn't an iPhone 5 cover. At least not one that I'd ever use.

I just saw the review saying this item is better than PowerSupport.This is completely wrong.The cutout is too large and looks terrible. I just put it on 5 minutes ago and am not pleased at all.Why is the cutout twice the $T$ of the speaker???I have tried every other AG SP since PowerSupport won't have any until "late October" and NONE can compare.PowerSupport is the absolute BEST AG SP hands down.I will wait until they are FINALLY on sale.Anything but PowerSupport just doesn't compare. I've tried so many brands now for iPhone 5 that its getting rediculous and makes it obvious to me that I will not find anything better than PS.

You can't beat the price (3 in the pack), and the installation and performance are excellent.  The only problem I have with the product is that it is marginally smaller than the actual screen $T$.  This may not be a problem for those who use a phone case that doesn't come over the face of the phone, or for those who use a really big case that covers a good portion of the face.  But for me, there remains a space between my case's bezel and the screen protector.  The result is the perfect grunge groove:  a place where lots of gunk accumulates. There's probably a good reason they make these just short of actual screen $T$, but for me it's a bit of a bummer. Still, this is an excellent product at an excellent price.

Having been through multiple generations of iPhones and multiple multiple generations of screen protectors, I've since learned that paying $20+ dollars for one is pure madness.  However, the cheaper ones i've never been totally happy with either...either the feel or the distortion or they come off after a bit.  But I think i've found the holy grail here - Generiks clear (NOT MATTE)  Looks like the iPhone glass, is crystal clear with no distortion or loss of resolution, has a cool 3 layer installation system (remove one layer to expose adhesive side, remove the top layer after you've pushed all the bubbles out - voila the middle layer is smooth and solid as can be), and has the perfect $T$d holes to accomodate the mic, camera and home button.  Best of all is the feel - most screens i've tried feel odd and take some getting used to - these ones I notice zero difference between the clear plastic and the glass.  It's great!  AND, oh yeah,  I paid less than 2 bucks a screen.  Honestly i never write reviews, but I'm very very happy with Generiks.  Serious, tell the dealer tryin' to get you to drop a 20 on a Zagg to go stuff it - and buy a pack of these instead.  A+++

When I had originally ordered my Kindle Fire, I purchased a single, slightly more ex$T$sive stylus, figuring one tablet only required one stylus so might as well get a good one. What I did not expect was one of my children pulling on the clip and the other one chewing on the tip whenever they could get their mitts on it. Within 24 hours the clip had been bent off and the tip chewed off. Simple logic would say not to let the kids touch it, but I purchased the tablet to use as a family and I don't want fingerprints all over the screen. So I decided to get a multi-pack of screen $T$s and chose this brand based solely on price and quantity.What I got was a far superior stylus. The clips are thicker and are very difficult to bend up and the rubber tips are very secure. I have two that I allow my children to use and I do not see these getting destroyed anytime soon. I could have easily bought a smaller pack and been just as happy, but now I have enough to match my mood with any color.Good price, worth more!

I love the colorful stylus!  I play lots of games and do texting. I've heard people comment about "fat finger" errors when typing. It made me laugh because I too would hit the wrong place when typing.  The stylus is a handy tool (and pretty too) for games and texting on my iphone and Kindle Fire. [Yes, I have Apple and Android. The best of both worlds!]  The stylus is fun and I can see the screen better on my iphone without my "fat fingers" blocking my view. I've placed multiple orders for this product. When a relative or friend comments about them, I give them one.  It's an inex$T$sive gift and they think of where it came from when the use it. :)

My principal blessed my first grade classroom with an iPad2 lab. I like all the handwriting apps that are available for kiddos but felt that students should be using something similar to a $T$/$T$cils when writing. So, I opted for this set of styli(?) because it was the cheapest for the most. They're great. One thing not mentioned in the product description is that the stylus is metal so it sticks to the magnets in the smartcover (that is, if you have a smartcover). Great deal! I always brag about the price I paid for them ($10) on Amazon :)

I love these things! I bought them fir my kindle fire because even though it has a screen protector I hated putting my fingers all over it. I think one thing that makes these $T$s better than other styluses is that the tips are rubber. I've given some of them away to family members they use it for the iphones and one person even uses it for their PS vita with no problem. i love the colors as well. Lastly you can't beat the price similar $T$s even for a pack of two are more ex$T$sive than this pack of seven.

After looking at the reviews and comparing prices, I decided to take a chance on these. I'm not disappointed so far. The colors have a metallic hue to them and they work on my iPhone 4s and iPad 2 great. I've heard about the tips breaking off on some, but that hasn't hap$T$ed yet. If you go to an office supply store, you'll find ONE of these with similar construction (about an inch taller though) for almost double the price you'd pay for this pack of SEVEN. For the price, even if one did break, I have 6 more to burn through. These would fit an average sized hand. They are about 5" in length.

Knowing how simple these little capacitive styli are to make, I've been appalled at the prices of these things in the big box office supplies retailers.  A search on Amazon back in 2011 turned up some for $1.00 each, which were OK, but flimsy, and took over a month to arrive from Hong Kong.  These little styli from The Friendly Swede are a bit more ex$T$sive, are much better quality, and still perhaps 10% of the cost of one from an office supplies chain store.  This is a great deal, especially when one takes advantage of the discount from the retailer on an additional pack of them.  I highly recommend this product.

My wife and I have several touch devices and I wanted to get a few extra $T$s.  The one I had was working well but wanted to have a spare in the event we lost one or the tip wore out.  I noticed that the Bluecell had a pack of seven for a decent price.  These work better than the $14 name brand $T$ I had previously purchased.  The $T$s slide smoothly across the surface of both our Ipad and Kindle Fire.  They are much lighter and slightly smaller than our previous $T$s.  They are built very solid - have a strong feel.I highly recommend these $T$s.  Tested on Ipad, Kindle Fire, LG 800.  All with great results.  Also worked well on devices with protector film as well as the bare screen.

The stylus $T$s work ok.  They don't always register the touch on an iPad screen, but work about 95 percent of the time.  The main problem we have with the $T$s is that only six of the $T$s were shipped even though we bought and paid for seven.  The seller doesn't have an option for contacting them so we are stuck not getting what we paid for.  It sounds like most people have had better luck than us, however we will make sure to not buy from this seller again since we didn't get what we paid for and have no way to get the situation rectified.

I ordered these to assist in note-taking on an iPad. Quite simply, they're cheap. But I knew that when I ordered them. They don't last a long time, especially under many hours of daily usage (I type my class notes, and then draw diagrams or take math notes on the iPad with Notes Plus).I would order a lot of these, so they become somewhat disposable like $T$cils. That, or order a nicer stylus and enjoy the build quality of that for a long time, like I did.But I think these serve a purpose--I keep a few of these in my backpack, laptop bag, and go-bag, and I leave the nice stylus at home.

I didn't pay a whole lot so but you get what you pay for! They are cheaply made they are hollow if you would step on one they would crush! The black part at the bottom just pushs in i have seen over $T$s that seem more soild i will not order from them again.

I've purchased stylus' from a couple of different sellers. These work just find on the aforementioned items. Responsive and seem be equal to their more ex$T$sive counterparts on Amazon. Some people seem to have reported problems on certain devices, but they work fine in my case. And you really can't beat the price.

the product was all it said it would be.  They work great with my Kindle Fire for playing games.  Some of the games I played required you to high light areas and my finger would not always provide the required touch for the constant pressure.  The $T$s provide the required pressure for typing and high lighting in the games I play.

They work just as described! I love them. Would buy again and probably will since they are easy to loose, just like $T$s. For me anyway!

I purchased this phone in August right after the Sunset version of the Blackberry Curve was released. It's my first Blackberry and my first smart phone (I upgraded from a Motorola Razr). I really wanted to love this phone, but I don't. Despite its sleek appearance and numerous cool features, this Crackberry is not at all what it's cracked up to be (pun intended).First, the good things: It's pretty. It's functional and easy to use. The QWERTY keyboard is fabulous, and I finally started text messaging people because I am now able to do it without cursing. The color screen is fantastic, Web browsing is slightly above average (most mobile browsers kind of suck), and the camera is pretty decent as well. The battery life is pretty long. As for the actual phone, $T$ is very clear. The unit itself is a bit awkward to hold against the ear, but it's not a flip phone and I could always get with the program and buy a hands-free device, so I'm not going to complain about that.However, despite all those great features, I hate this stupid phone. My biggest complaint is that it locks up on me ALL THE TIME! That blue hourglass appears on the screen about 70% of the time I have the phone turned on. The constant "updating" makes the rest of the device slow and sluggish, and to my knowledge there is no way to speed that up. Also, sometimes the hourglass refuses to go away after 10 or 15 minutes, and I'm forced to take the entire battery out and reboot my phone, which is also time consuming. That happens at least once a week. In addition to that, my phone apparently came with some sort of poltergeist, because sometimes the red light will flash and the phone will start beeping WHEN IT'S TURNED OFF! Plus, although I have the settings adjusted to store e-mails and text messages for 30 days, sometimes the phone decides to delete everything all by itself without even prompting me (and not necessarily just when I have a ton of messages in the inbox, either). Finally, this phone does not shoot video! I suppose it's my own fault for not realizing that it lacked that feature before I made the purchase, but I seriously did not expect a $250 phone to lack something as simple as video capabilities. Ridiculous!The bottom line is, even though this is a nice looking phone, I have had more problems with it than any other mobile device (I actually miss my old Razr!). If T-Mobile offered the iPhone, I would ditch my Crackberry in a heartbeat. Unfortunately, though, it looks like I'm stuck with this stupid thing for a while longer.

Note: This is for the red color phone but since there are more reviews on the black phone, I'm putting the Reality review here. [The Piano Red is a really nice color :-)]This is my first internet-enabled phone.  It does exactly what I needed to.  In addition to calling, I text a ton and occasionally use the internet to check ESPN, GMail, or get directions.  [The BING application is wondrous for directions for a phone of this kind.]I wish that GMail was easier to check (there may be a way that I don't know), and wallpapers change with the touch of a button along with app buttons.Overall, while most people have a Droid phone, I'm pretty happy with this basic phone.  [I'm usually two years behind the curve with most technology :-)]No negative comments on call clarity, $T$, ease of dial4ing etc.  Nothing seems wrong with basic phone usage.

A new every two upgrade, $53 got me this phone.  R2d2 benefited from all bug fixes complained off for the prior 6 months for Droid 2, so this phone functions without a glitch.  Everything that should happen, does happen.  Phone quality and $T$ is as good as most dedicated phones; downloading Android Marketplace apps, syncing with google, etc., are all flawless.  I migrated 700 phone numbers from my Palm phone easily, but it was tougher to get Palm dba schedules into google.  PC sync is easy, just plug it in, and it becomes a virtual drive.  Removable microSDHC cards are a plus, as you can upgrade memory when needed, and use multiple cards to keep a lot of multimedia, swapping when needed.Most Android apps I use are free, and many equivalent ones I reviewed need to be purchased for use on an iPhone.Unlike most phones I've owned since 1995, r2d2 consumes batteries faster because its more like a real handheld multitasking PC with a phone, that just a phone + PDA as most smartphones used to be. Without any use, it drops 10% a day, and with computer usage, it depends on what you do.  Charging is fast, 50% to 100% in ~ 1 hour, and original Moto batteries are now only $5, so easy to get extras if needed, and its easily user replaceable.The biggest flaw in r2d2 is Android's internal security, encryption, which is well known as of this writing.  We await the new API and Moto is making their own to fix this flaw sooner than the Android developers.  You can get Apps that can do it for you right now, but its clunky and works only on a per application basis, rather than global.

I have been with Sprint Wireless for 1 month today, after switching from Verizon.  I love my phone (HTC EVO Design 4G).  I should qualify that I love my phone now that it is working.  I had to take it back 6 days after purchasing it because the display kept shutting off 10-15 seconds after I did anything, even though the settings were set to shut off after 5 minutes.  The cell phone $T$ has been about the same as what we experienced with Verizon, spotty in some areas but OK in most areas.I must say though that the customer service that I have received from Sprint has been abominably poor.  I had to call to have a charge taken off my first bill that I did not authorize.  As of today (2 weeks after I first called and two more calls later), the erroneous charge still shows on my bill and my account shows past due because of it.  I purchased two phones (both the same model) at the same time.  The second phone is now giving the same problem as the first one was before it was replaced, shutting off at very short intervals.  We have taken it back to the Sprint store where we purchased it.  Three different employees in that store (Southcenter Parkway store in Tukwila, WA) have been extremely rude to us.  They refuse to look at the second phone without charging us $35 each time.  Even when they didn't fix the problem, when we take it back they want another $35.  I only paid $99 for the phone in the first place.  Why should I have to repurchase the phone $35 at a time when the phone is only 30 days old since I purchased it.  It has not been dropped or damaged - the display is defective.  It is supposedly under a 1 year warranty from the manufacturer, but the Sprint Store refuses to honor this.  Today, they advised that the phone has a defective motherboard, but they still refuse to fix it unless we pay $35 (in addition to the other two visits where they charged us to reset the phone and it did not fix the problem).  We have asked to speak to a supervisor or manager and one is never available and they will not give us a manager's name to contact later.  I have tried three different times to contact Sprint Customer Service by phone.  All three times, I get to talk to an employee who asks my name and account info.  Then they put me on hold.  In all three cases, I was on hold for over 30 minutes and finally hung up.Sprint does not stand behind the product they sell and they will not honor the manufacturer's warranty.  They make it impossible to speak to anyone at their company about the problem.  I highly recommend that you avoid doing business with this company.  THEY STINK BIG TIME.  :(

Wilson makes top of the line cellular repeater products. The Wilson AG Pro 75 dB adjustable gain dual band amplifier in this kit is as good as it gets. With automatic 'oscillation'/'feedback' detection and adjustable gain, it makes it easy to set up your exterior and interior antennas. The internal panel antenna in the kit is directional and thus helps in avoiding feedback also. The wide-band directional external antenna works in both cellular (800 MHz) and PCS (1900 MHz) range (in some weak $T$ situations you may want to use the Yagi antennas from Wilson instead, which provide the highest gain permitted by the FCC, but do require two separate antennas, one for the CLR band and one for the PCS band --- or, consider the parabolic dishes from ZDA Communications, which have excellent gain, directionality, low side lobes and high back-to-front ratio). Finally, the R400 coax from Wilson has only 4 dB per 100' attenuation (even RG-6 has over 8dB per 100' loss) -- for runs over 100', consider substituting the thicker Wilson R600, which has even lower loss).

We are working on a concrete framed home at a beach location with little to no cell reception to start. We called Wilson tech support and they convinced us that if we set this up correctly it would work. The key is to make sure you get the outside directional antenna aimed correctly. From there we installed three inside antennas and and additional booster amp and two taps. The home is 7 floors and mostly concrete and metal construction. The movie theater is two stories subterranean.  When we fired it up all the workers phones started beeping with messages and ringing with calls. For two years they have worked with virtually no cell phones. Now AT&T; and Verizon users usually have 4-5 bars and NO dropped calls ANYWHERE in the home.  People in the neighborhood can walk by and pull a stronger $T$ from the street that we are providing over the cell phone company.Highly recommended and Wilson tech support was very patient and walked us through each step.

I purchased this for an office located inside of a metal building.  Before we received no $T$ or maybe one bar if you were near a window.  With the booster, we now have 4 bars.  So far so good, it does exactly what it's supposed to do.  No more missed calls or going outside to use the phone.

I am 43 km away (27 mi.) from the cell tower in the Canadian Laurentians as the crow flies. Furthermore, the $T$ has to get around 2 mountains at the same height as the radiating tower. Hooked-up to 2 yagi antennas stacked on top of one another, this amplifier turn out to be the only working device at my cabin in the wilderness. Getting both GSM in the 850-900 MHz and 3G $T$s 5M5 even in bad weather conditions. It literally made the difference between phone and no-phone at all. Highly recommended for areas in  fringe areas of cell reception (having intermittent -101 to -104 dBm to start with on the roof of the cabin!).

I bought this kit in an attempt to improve the non-existent cell $T$ inside my home. Outside my house, I'd have two to three bars... inside, we'd get maybe one bar on a good day. Most times I'd try to call my wife at home (on her cell) and her phone wouldn't even ring. I was a little concerned that I'd have problems with this kit because it has a directional antenna that works best with an unobstructed path to the cell tower you are trying to communicate with. My house is surrounded by large, dense trees that completely obscure about fifty degrees of the horizon where the cell tower is located. With little effort, I was able to get a great $T$ from the cell tower (Sprint PCS). I added an additional indoor antenna -Wilson Dual Band (700-2700 MHz), which required more cable -50 feet WILSON400 Ultra Low Loss Coax, a splitter -Wilson 700-2700 MHz Splitter, a short piece of coax (to run the splitter to the amp) -Wilson 2-Foot WILSON400 Ultra Low Loss Coax. I probably didn't need the additional indoor antenna, but I tend to go for overkill when I tackle a project. I mounted the outside antenna withWinegard DS-2000 Universal Antenna Mount with U-boltsby simply drilling through my siding and attaching the mount with 6 3/16&#34;x2&#34; lag bolts. Drilled through a side roof vent, ran the cable inside and caulked the hole. Then went into my attic, added an outlet to plug my amp into, then ran the two indoor antennas through the attic and placed them face down in the attic under the insulation. Now we have a three to six bar $T$ throughout our home where before our cellphones were virtually unusable.The only issue I have is that the seller did not include a lightning surge protector with this kit. I had to purchaseWilson Electronics 859902 Surge Protectoralong with an additional short length of cable, as well as electrical wire and a grounding rod to make this system safe in my home. I understand not including the electric wire and the grounding rod, as these can be purchased at any hardware store, but the surge protector is so important and so application specific that it should be included with the kit. Folks, this kind of surge protector isn't like the power bar you plug your computer or TV into. The coax cable screws into either side of it and then an electric cable connects it to a copper coated rod that you pound into the ground. If you don't protect your computer and there's a surge, you might have your computer destroyed. If you don't surge protect this cell phone $T$ booster kit and lightning strikes the cell antenna, there is a very good chance that the lightning will cause an electrical explosion in your attic and burn your house down.All things considered, this is a great kit that worked wonders in my home. I'd recommend it to anyone needing to boost the $T$ in their home or office. Just make sure you add the surge suppressor to the kit.

This amplifier does work great....but...a few things you need to know....the setup I purchased came with a directional amplifier....if you can see the cell tower or know exactly where it is without seeing  (line of sight) this this should work for you really well because it is a high gain.  It did not work for me because I am so far remote I have no idea where the nearest cell is, and I have rolling hills.  I went back and purchased the Wilson Omnidirectional antenna.  It worked better as far as $T$ strength than the directional, only because the direction must be pointed at the target.

A couple months ago, I had a Nokia 3120;however, I wanted to try something new.  So I purchased a Motorola v551.  At first I was happy I did so, but later I regreted it.  So, I went back to my lovely Nokia 3120, and it compares highly to the quality and fondness of the Motorola.  I absolutely love my Nokia 3120.  It has great reception, great image quality, great battery power, and a great $T$.  I have Cingular and I live in CA, and CA is renowned for it's bad reception and I still get wonderful reception.  It is also a very low price.I highly recommend this phone.

At first glance I fell in love with the phone - the small $T$, the chrome plated front, all my friends just love it, thinking its another high-priced, fancy phone from nokia/cingular, when surprisingly it was very affordable, but I must admit - it IS fancy, yet extremely "phone newbie" friendly.It has everything you want and need plus more. It has text messaging, multimedia messaging, polyphonic ringtones, MEDIA NET, to download many more ringtones, games, applications, ANYTHING else you may want or need for your nokia 3120, can be found on media net. It's the internet on your phone, letting you download practically anything you may want, including java apps. If youre at work, the movies, or dont feel like calling anyone, you can go ahead and use your instant message feature, by logging onto AIM or YAHOO to chat with your buddies. There are many more features to this phone - like any screensaver you could want, you can even record your own voice or music to use as a ringtone.Popular? 300 contacts/Calendar with 500 entries.Cant get up in the morning? Alarm clock.Timing something? Stopwatch/countdown.Bilingual? English, French, Spanish, Portuguese languages supported.You can talk for 6 hours if you like on this phone, or you can go ahead and leave it on your desk for over 16 DAYS, yes DAYS, and still be able to talk. Total standby time is 17 days.The call quality is great, except if you put the the phone too close to a stereo or your speakers, it makes the speakers beep, which is the only downside, but is totally negligable.I'd give this phone 4/5 stars, because of all the features you can have on a phone that's 4.01 inches long x 1.68 inches wide x 0.76 inch thick, and weighs just about 3 ounces.

The first thing I definitely noticed with this phone is that it gets really hot when I use it.I didn't expect the camera to be great, and so it wasn't a big surprise that it wasn't.The phone is really hard to use. Using almost any feature is really difficult, because trying to find it through the menus takes forever. Just setting up a certain ring for a person is hard.The name dial feature is nice and works fairly well. You can call a person by saying their name without having to record it first. The only problem is that's it's also badly $T$ed. To use it you have to hold down the Talk button for about 2 seconds, wait for the logo screen to appear and disappear, then you have to say Name Dial, then finally the name, so that it takes at least 8-10 seconds. If it doesn't recognize what you say, you have to repeat the process.The contacts menu is also badly organized. I got spoiled by a nice Kyocera phone that let me just type in the person's name from the main screen and it would find it from there. To do that with this phone you have to go to the contacts screen and type in the name, or remember whatever speed dial number the person randomly ended up with (it's based on the order you put them in).Anyway, it's a mess trying to use the phone. It works well enough for me when talking to people, except that the phone really does pretty hot after only a few minutes of talking.

It was contract renewal time, so visions of new phones for myself and my family danced through my head.  I'd been pouring over every detail of the droid phones and the iPhone.  My 14 year old son asked..."Aren't they running out of things for phones to do?"  I laughed, but then I thought about his question.It's a loaded question and I knew what he was getting at.  The silliness of the phone 'pissing contest' with all the youtube videos comparing one to another. The giant screens.  Useless gimmicks like `Siri'I decided to stop, take a breath, and decide what I truly needed in a PHONE. I had 160 apps on my Droid and I literally used about 10-15 of those.  The rest were part of the 'pissing contest' ("Hey, do you see what my phone can do!?  Bro-stache!  Voice warping software!  3D games!")I needed 100% accuracy in texts and emails.  Clear phone calls.  At least a workdays worth of battery life (10 hours of heavy usage).  Contacts and calendar sync with gmail.  `To do' list.  The ability to handle multiple email accounts, including Exchange.  A simple, decent camera.  Medical apps like Epocrates.  Music apps like Pandora, Shazaam, Slacker radio.  Utilities like Evernote, Dropbox.  You get the idea.  Mostly as a functioning phone, a real phone with organizing tools, but with a few entertainment things.First let me say that it is truly a beautiful phone.  Slim, sleek, stunning $T$.  One of the best LOOKING phones ever.  The touch screen is vivid, crisp, and clear.Now, about my `needs' from my PHONE.Accuracy.  I am a physican at a busy hospital and we communicate with each other EXTENSIVELY via text throughout the day.  The main problem I'd had with my Droid Incredible was the virtual keyboard.  If I spent an hour a day texting, literally 15 minutes of that time would be erasing incorrect 'auto corrections'.  My thumbs will never get smaller, I will always hit the wrong keys on a virtual keyboard.  I had several keyboards on the Droid with very sophisticated prediction software, learning the words I used most, etc.  It will never be good enough.  iPhone keyboard is far worse, with absolutely horrid options for customization.  Blackberry 9930 keyboard is the best thing I've ever typed on.  I've never used a BB before but I took to it instantly.Instead of BB's stupid Bold commercial showing bicyclists with glow-in-the-dark wheels driving around, they need to show me at the hospital smashing my virtual keyboard phone against the wall....then cut away to me smiling as I discover what typing on a phone can be like.  Stunning.  If texting, emailing, and accuracy are important to you, don't underestimate this keyboard as it truly separates this phone from anything else available.Clear, loud phone calls.  EXCELLENT noise reduction.  People hear me and I hear them.  Perfect.Battery is decent.  BB users are not thrilled because they are spoiled with 2 days of use in their old, slow, no feature phones.  This thing is fast, with a brilliant screen, and it needs juice.  I am thrilled with it because I come from the land of Droid where you have to charge the phone multiple times per day.  It gets me through long days.  I bought the extra battery with dual charger from Amazon, but I have not had to use the second battery yet.  There's a HUGE extended battery available, but it makes it look nuts.  Some people don't mind, but I love the sleek look, so I will never get that.Syncs with gmail, contacts, calendar.  Not as smoothly/thoroughly as Droid devices, of course, but it works very well.Multiple email accounts no problem.  POP, IMAP, Exchange.LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the camera!  It doesn't have `auto focus' it has some sort of way to focus on everything at the same time.  Forget what they call it?  IT DOES NOT TAKE CLOSE-UP PICTURES WELL!  So, if you are buying your phone with a need for close-up photos, this phone will not suit you.  The dedicated camera key is soooo convenient.  Why is this not on every phone?  Fast, clear, fun to take pictures.BB app world has an atrocious set up.  It's confusing, some apps are not represented in BB app world, you have to go to the developer web site to get many programs, app world constantly signs you out when you are browsing on the computer, etc.  But most of the major apps are available, and they work fine.  Everything I need is available.  You too will be fine with apps, it will just take a little digging.  App world needs some work.OH, one of the things I love the absolute most about this phone is the INSTANT UNIVERSAL SEARCH!  Start typing and the phone starts searching your apps, your texts/emails, contacts, etc for matches.  You can set it up so it searches just the things you want it to search.  It's amazing and it's INSTANT.  It's better than iPhone's swipe (that's already an extra step), and type (on the virtual keyboard that sucks), and it includes INSTANT WEB SEARCHES AS YOU TYPE VIA BING!!  Amazing.  (As an aside, I love google search and I think you can set it to that, but I'm finding Bing's TV commercials are pretty accurate.  I'm getting too much irrelevant information on google.  Bing is pretty impressive.)I suggest you sit down and write out what you need from your phone.  This BB will NEVER beat iPhone and the latest Droids for speed, apps, screen size, gaming.  But, it doesn't need to because it's a better PHONE.Love this phone.  My wife got the Galaxy Nexus as did one of my sons.  My other boy got an iPhone 4S.  I feel that my choice is a better actual functioning phone.  I LOVE IT.  However, I won't win the `pissing contest' as they are downloading the latest 3D Magic 8-ball app.

Reasons I chose to upgrade from my BlackBerry Tour to this phone, over an iPhone:1. OS 7 is fast.2. Sleek $T$.3. Physical Keyboard is awesome.  Can't stand typing or, even worse, editing on a virtual keyboard.4. Global roaming capable.5. Removable (i.e. easily upgradeable and inexpensive) microSD.6. Standard microUSB, not proprietary connector / charger.7. Touchpad is aweseome.8. Touch screen is a bonus.9. BlackBerry Bridge to work with my PlayBook.10. BES (BlackBerry Enterprise Server) delivers INSTANT email.  No other phone works that quickly, often with a 2-10 minute delay.  Very important to me to keep up at work.  Also most tightly integrated with Outlook (even pictures of my contacts are on my BB).So far, I have not had any reliability issues.  Apps are limited compared to the iPhone but majority of those I need are available.  The ones that are missing for the BB tend to be more entertaining (e.g. Angry Birds) than useful tools.

The trackpads on both of the 9930's I bought from Amazon third party sellers featured slightly crooked trackpads in the counter-clockwise direction.On one of them, the sensitivity of the trackpad itself was way too low - I wouldn't have realized this if not for the other 9930 I tried, on which the trackpad, while crooked, was quick and fluid.But on the phone with the good (but crooked) trackpad, the Back button was squeaky when you press it - very, VERY annoying.Blackberry's Quality Control actually let these things ship like that? Unacceptable.Then there's the atrociously $T$ed (search doesn't even really work) and underwhelming Blackberry App-World - clearly developers have forsaken the entire platform, including Google (an ancient version of google maps).I am pretty sure I'm within my rights to expect squared up geometry and non-flimsy, rock solid buttons, but apparently RIM can't compete in the build-quality area anymore, and these things cost too much for anything less than perfect.The camera lacks auto-focus, another critical error, although it still beats Motorola cameras (which ain't sayin' much).

So I bought universal screen protectors and they blew bubbles and everything.I bought these best 10 bucks I've spent.  They are same price as the universal ones but fit your phone so no cutting to the right $T$.  It took me five mins to put this on they give you the tools to help make it easier.  Screen cleaning cloth, Rubber finger things and instructions that are detailed.  Great product would buy again and most likely will.  I only had one bubble upon installation and it only took a sec to get it out.Great product keep it up Lexerd.

Despite the small $T$ of the package, it came with the screen protector, a microfiber cloth, two finger cots and a small plastic card to use as a squeegee.  The screen is crystal clear and the application was a snap.  Just be sure to take your time, follow the instructions and are in a dust free environment.The screen protector fits perfectly and the touch screen sensitivity is only reduced a tiny amount.  You notice it a little a first, particularly with the "fixed" keys at the bottom of the Captivate, but compared to other screen protectors I've used, this is top notch. Like with all plastic protectors, you won't have the perfectly smooth glass "glide" of an unprotected screen, but again compared to other screen protectors this one is one of the best. Once you apply the protector you will notice a tiny "edge" around the screen where it doesn't seem like it is adhering. However, it is uniform all the way around the screen, quite small and you have to really look to notice. Bubbles are easy to remove with the enclosed plastic card, just be sure to be gentle when squeegeeing them to the sides.The only downside to the true view is that it is a bit of a fingerprint magnet.  Not bad considering so is the Captivates screen.Good work Lexerd.

First of all, why do they make these things so hard to put on?  I had to go thru most of them and throw them away until I finally got one right.  But I think it's like that with all of these things.  You have to be in a completely dust, lint, and finger print free zone to get one of these things on perfectly.  But, it was the exact $T$ and they came with a lint cloth.  So far the film has held up great on the phone.  Good deal.

Works great, fits well and is easy to set up and use. I'm not sure if others have this feature but I'd sure like it if you could tell how much charge was left in the $T$. I hate going out with it just to have it die in the middle of a call. Battery life is not bad but I just cannot tell how much charge is left so I end up constantly charging it.

"....By  Ronald J. Rio "rjr" (Colorado) - See all my reviews(REAL NAME)I'm really impressed with the flexibility of this headset. You can use it with the boom or without, with the ear-clips or without, 4 different sets of buds, you get the picture. I replaced my old Motorolla H500. This was different for me with the buds, which definitely improves the sound quality. The link to my BB8830 was flawless. I really, really, love the stereo adapter - for music AND for phone calls. When in stereo, all outside noise is shutout which is great for listening to business calls. I have not had cordless stereo headsets before, but used these on a 5 hour flight and the $T$ held all the way, music quality was good. Not as dynamic as wired buds, but no interuption, static, etc. Very impressive for the low price.""Ronald hit is on the head.  I also love them. I use it at work to listen to the music on my LG Dare phone, and only use the mono earpiece, I don't use the stereo one, but it work great with or without.  answering calls is the best too.  you can slide the boom, or press the answer button, talk and then hang up and it goes right back to the song that you were listening too.It's terrific. A must have.  If I could give it a 8 out of a 10 I would.

I have had several other Plantronics and some Motorola bluetooths and they have all had their shortcomings, but this one ranks the best. The stereo quality is impressive and the $T$ life is really good. My only complaint is my ear type isn't really accepting to the buds which slip out often. The biggest fear I have is that it is slipping one time when my hands aren't free and hits the ground. I love my bluetooth, I just don't know how long it'll last unless there are other buds that I'm just not aware of. Overall, great device but not made for ALL ear sizes (mine are too small).

I have used MANY different bluetooth headsets.  This one was my first stereo headset, however.  Overall, this headset is amazing.  The stereo quality is quite remarkable.  Other than bass response, they are nearly as good as my Sony wired headsets, but they are WIRELESS!  I can't tell you how amazing it is to just have it lightly wrapped behind your neck.  It's a delight.  And if you just need mono, just pop off the little cable and you're good-to-go.  And the audio is still crystal clear from the single mono headset.  I am using this with the iPhone 3Gs, and all of the features work except track skip (still seeing if it's something I'm doing wrong).  When a call comes in, just slide the little boom out toward your mouth and voila, music stops and it answers the call.  Done with the call, slide it back in and the music starts right back up!  Need to pause the music, just push a little button on the top, and it pauses.  Start back up?  Just push the little button again!  Voice dial?  But of course!  Just hold the call button down about 2 seconds and your prompted with the iPhone's voice control!  Absolutely a delight to use.  LONG $T$ life.  I have been listening to it for HOURS on end at a pretty high volume, made quite a few calls, and it's still going strong.  I have NO complaints about the unit.  Feels great in my ears.  Very light, very comfortable.  And it's even a steal of a deal now that it's dropped so much in price.  If you're in the market for a GREAT bluetooth headset, this one should most certainly be on your short list.

it is a nice headset no longer time to $T$ charge but i can use it for two weeks(for normal use), and also low-priced for good specifications.

Immediately upon using this unit (replacement for identical Z9i that I lost), I noticed the $T$ life was less--far, far less. I made do for a while, maybe a month or two. Now, I have no $T$ life at all--maybe 1 or 2 minutes--after a full charge. I was quite satisfied with my original Z9i. The $T$ life was sufficient. What do I do now? Amazon, you're a pretty stellar outfit. Do you want to just send me a new one? It feels weird to purchase yet another one when I have a nearly new one on my kitchen counter--albeit with a stone cold dead $T$...

This bluetooth is a great deal!! It fits in my ear perfectly, also, I have not had any problems with people being able to hear me or with me being able to hear them, volume is great, and the color is cute and stylish! Also, the $T$ lasts forever! I only recharge like once every 3 days.

Well, as a female, I do like the pink color. That's the first reason I chose this headset. When I got it, the functionality is also a value add to it.Pros:1. Long standby time. I made 4-5 calls a day, and it already lasted for more than 6-7 days (with high $T$) without charging .2. Clear voice in hearing and speaking.3. Pair to my iphone and SamSung Glaxary Tab easily4. Easy to wear, even for a female with small ear hole like me, it fit on the ear perfectly. I can wear this just by one hand.Cons:1. The backgroud noise seems to be an issue, when calling, the others can hear my backgroud noise clearly. But it's not an issue when calling in a quite place.2. The size is a little bit big for a female user like me, but still acceptable.The overall user experience for this BT headset is great.

Honestly, I wasn't expecting much out of this because it was only $15 or so when I bought it and my husband spent $40 on his headset. But, shockingly, the little thing works great. The $T$ life is quite impressive, and it fits well in my ear and stays in place. The audio sounds slightly tinny but I don't notice it much and it's never interfered with the function in any way.

The bluetooth works fine, the stereo sound is good, and the silicone earbuds are comfortable and secure.  I don't know how noise-isolating they are, but they feel good and they do block noise at least compared to regular earbuds.However.  The earbud cord is made of a stiff, plasticky material rather than a more flexible substance.  It is absurdly long, and cords from the individual earbuds to the main cord are of different lengths for some unfathomable reason.  Altogether, this results in a mess of cord hanging from your ears and flapping around your waist.  There is a clip to clip the cord to your shirt, but if you use that, then the earbuds pull every time you turn your head, unless you leave enough cord free above the clip, which is annoying and looks dumb.  If you don't use the lanyard, you must use the clip on the pendant or else it will pull the earbuds out of your ears.  If you clip the pendant to your belt and you want to take the earbuds out, they will hang around your ankles.  But if you use the lanyard to hang the pendant around your neck, the situation is even worse because the lanyard adds another foot or two of cord -- truly, the cord length is ridiculous.  The lanyard is also made of a thick, plasticky material that retains the crimps caused by the manner in which it is packaged.  And if you do use the lanyard and you want to remove the earbuds and let them hang, then they hang around your shins (higher than if you don't use the lanyard and clip the pendant to your belt, but still ridiculous).  If you don't use the lanyard, then you must clip the pendant to your clothing and deal with the stiff earbud cords flapping around.  It looks messy and unprofessional and the cords get in the way.The $T$ is located on one of the earbud cords, and it hangs too low - nearer my chest than my mouth.  People on the other end of phone calls complained of the sound quality even when I held the $T$ near my mouth.Finally, every time you push a button, there is a loud beep in the earphones.  So, if you want to increase the volume by hitting the volume up button a couple of times, you get a loud beep each time you push it, which also interrupts the music.All in all, I wanted to like this, but had to return it.  I don't recommend it.  There are better solutions out there.  I opted for the LG HBS-110.  The design of that one is very good, but I wish it had silicone earbuds like the Plantronics.

I rate this as the best thing I have ever purchased for my iPhone. I do a lot of phone conferencing and making it easy to hear and easier to be heard while I adjust graphics to the clients wishes is now far easier. Previously, I was crushing the iPhone against my ear so that at the end of a teleconferencing session my ear really hurt. This has been so much better. Their design is noise canceling by nature and the $T$ works well in high noise situations. I had a little discomfort at the beginning getting used to the tightness BUT I soon grew accustomed to it and it was far better than crushing the iPhone against my head.

To me these are the perfect headphones for any apple device. The built-in volume control and $T$ make it easy to adjust the volume and advance (or retreat) to the desired song on your iPad, iPod or iPhone. They are relatively inexpensive and the sound quality is acceptable.

I bought this $T$ to replace the original in my old Nokia model 6010.  The transaction was simple and for about 6 bucks I had one delivered in about a week.  I am vey satisfied with the vendor.  The new $T$ takes a charge just as it should.  I would buy from them again.

The first $T$ when plugged into my charger showed no life at all, no $T$ bar, etc.  However when I left it in the charger for about an hour, the $T$ meter showed up and started moving.  My phone works in the cold now.  So wait for at least 2 hours if ya want to try to avoid frustration in thinking ya have a bad $T$.  (I haven't tested it beyond about a month so..)

As another review mentioned, this replacement $T$ is slightly larger than the original, but it still fits in the phone just fine.  My previous $T$ (about 5 years old) finally started to die (would only hold a charge for a few hours, even though the readout on the screen reported a fully-charged $T$).  I bought this replacement for a mere few dollars and now my phone is working great, again.

Bought from : Regain Computers thru Amazon - So other retailers might vary.  Had to click NEW and select the alternative merchant Regain.Battery shipped and was received within 2 days by USPS.  Very QuickTotal Cost was $12.49 after shipping.  Was looking for a 35H0123 $T$ to replace my HTC Touch Pro 2 batteries that just don't last a whole day.  Previous batteries were 35H00123-02M and generic china replacement batteries, none of them would last a whole day (24 hrs) no matter how I let them discharge then full charge.  Batteries just don't last long anymore, even the HTC batteries (I have 2 of them).Wanting a real HTC $T$ I ran across this OEM HTC Imagio Standard Battery 35H00123-11M 1500ma and figured lets give it a try, for $8 + $4.49 shipping I didn't have much to lose.2 Days later I received a 'Sprint OEM' $T$, 1500mAh, 3.7V, 5.6Wh, Cells From Japan, Model BTDHS51115L, for use with Snap/Hero/Evo 4G.  I'm thinking great I got another generic $T$ that isn't going to last.  I went ahead and swapped it into the phone and let it fully charge for a few hours (was at 50% when I started, charged it to 100% green light in the phone).That was 48 hours ago!  With some phone calls, multiple email checking, web surfing, SMS messages, I've had my phone successfully running for over 48 hours!  I've never had this HTC Touch Pro 2 go this long!  % of $T$ left = 40% !!!  I plan to keep going to see exactly how long it will last but this $T$ definitely gets my vote to handle a high power device like the Touch Pro 2 for over 48 hours.  Backlight was set to 100% brightness too, although I normally use 60% I had left it in 100% for this particular test.So if you are looking for a $T$ for your HTC device and it uses the '35H00123' 1500ma series batteries, I definitely recommend this particular BTDHS51115L from Regain Computers.Update!! I was able to achieve a total of 68 hours of texting/web/email/some voice with this new $T$ before it hit 10% and asked to turn off the phone.  The % change was very consistent/linear from 100% to 10%, unlike my generic batteries that will go from 50% to 10% within 30 minutes.  Extremely happy with this Sprint OEM $T$.  Two Thumbs Up!!

The standard $T$ that comes with the LG enV Touch is not very good.  I ordered this extended life $T$ and could not be happier.  The $T$ has almost twice the $T$ life as the original, and it also matches the phone in color and design.  The only drawback (which I already knew before getting it) is that the $T$ sticks out about 1/4 inch from the back of the phone.  I knew this already so I was prepared for it.  To me I don't care.  It sits in my pocket about like it did with the original $T$.  I would definitely recommend this $T$ to anyone who has the LG enV Touch.

Can't really get too excited about a cellphone $T$.  It does what it's supposed to do, power my cellphone.

The $T$ worked perfectly. I was considering purchasing a five dollar $T$, but after reading other peeps negative reviews about the cheaper priced ones i opted for this one. If i had bought a cheap one, i would have spent more money because i would have had to buy an additional $T$, just to get something that works. So yeah, this 1 is great. The charge lasts just as much as the original's. I would recommend this to others :)

I had been researching the Samsung AB553446GZ $T$ for the SCH-U340 phone.  I was tempted to go with a "cheapie" one but after reading bad reviews I went for this one for $20.  It was worth the extra money.  It arrived fully charged.  I have had it for about a month and it takes a full charge.  I am very pleased that the seller, Accessory Distributor, is selling a new OEM $T$, as described.  It did not arrive as pictured in a blister pack.  It was in a small zipped plastic bag.  It is somewhat difficult to find this $T$ because it is for an old flip phone from 2008.  I was a little concerned that the $T$ would not be good because of the poor shelf life of lithium batteries, but it works very well and I am very happy with it.  And it was cheaper than buying a new phone!

Bought this after being disappointed by the poor performance of a $5 "OEM". This the real deal.Most batteries are way overpriced, and I have always been completely satisfied with the quality of "budget" CR123s.

I have to report that this one was a disappointment.  The $T$ looks just like the original and performs just like it.  Not so good since the original only holds a charge for three to four hours on standby.  This is installed in a flip phone, so no excess power demands.  You may get a better one than I did.

This is a nice looking case and well $T$ed.  Unfortunately, the magnet inside the case is not position correctly for the 8300 and the phone does not recognize that it is in the holster.The first time I traveled out of town I snapped the case off my belt.  The plastic broke off the clip.  Needless to say, I didn't buy another one.Pass on this case!

I have been looking for a Bluetooth gateway for my car since it has an Aux input in the armrest and I have been wanting to get rid of the wires.  I searched on Amazon and purchased the Miccus Blubridge gateway and this blackberry gateway.  After using both for a week now, the winner hands down is the Blackberry.  They both produce very clean sound with no hiccups on my Iphone 4.  The Miccus has a built in battery, but since this will never leave my car I don't see a need for it and having it always plugged in will cause memory effect on the battery as well.  The Miccus also was not as loud as the Blackberry.The Blackberry will blow you away with the volume and sound $T$!  The most important reason for choosing the Blackberry is that it "remembers" your device!  I get into my car, start it up and choose my music...its that quick. This device saved me from buying a new stereo.  My Iphone 4 with pandora and sirius playing with the incredible sound $T$ of the Blackberry gateway makes commutes very enjoyable.  You won't be sorry....

Shipping was fast and easy and it was packaged very well. The headset itself looks great, nice curve design to it, feels really comfortable on my head. The $T$ cushions do a great job for comfort, I wore these one day for a few hours straight and it felt like they weren't even on my head! No pressure added on your $T$s, they don't make your $T$s "hot" and "warm", its very comfortable. As for sound, its pretty good! I tested a few audio recordings, the sound is very cl$T$ and crisp, at times you need to speak up but it picks up your voice very well. Audio playback on this headset is very good as well. Overall this is a pretty great headset for the price and feels good!

I had previously owned a Plantronics headset which produced excellent sound quality, but had an $T$piece fall off after about two y$T$s. I bought this one thinking I could trust the name. Simply put, it has constant glitches in playback (it's not getting the signal properly from the computer) and it produces an intermittent clipping regardless of volume, as if the gain is somehow being overloaded. This is a problem that only occurs when using this headset, and not while playing back over other speakers or even cheap $T$buds. I will not likely buy another Plantronics product in future.

During the first few times w$T$ing this headset, I have to admit that it was definitely a little different and awkward. Many headsets are over the $T$ and is round, usually with the headband attached down the middle of the $T$piece. Here, this Plantronics headset's headband attaches on one end of the $T$piece. Essentially, it felt like I was w$T$ing a headset backwards. Besides the minor adjustment, this headset has decent sound and microphone.The design is good and definitely not cheap. The headband is felxible and makes the chances of breaking less likely. It also sits on the head very lightly and can be worn for long periods of time. You may also flip up the microphone when not in use. It's not intrusive when flipped up. The chord isn't the strongest, but is definitely good enough for a casual, at-home, or at work use.As I had mentioned, the sound isn't too bad, but there's not much thump or bass. The microphone is fairly good, cl$T$ly capturing my voice. It's good enough for some casual voiceover recording, skype/videochat, and for work.Overall, not bad, it's lightweight, comfortable, and fulfills basic needs.

I bought and returned a Logitech USB headset because the sound quality was really poor.  Using internet calling, I could barely h$T$ the person on the other end.  Logitech might seem fancy on the outside but it's a piece of garbage on the inside.  After purchasing the Plantronics, oh my goodness... it just blew the Logitech away.  The sound is much louder and beyond audible.  It's perfect.  If you'd rather get performance over build quality, get the Plantronics.  It may seem a little flimsier but the sound quality is 100% better.  Amazing product!  Thank you Plantronics for not ripping me off.

The microphone audio quality is perfect for VOIP or gaming, cl$T$ with great noise cancellation. The headphone audio quality is acceptable, about as good as my cheap Sony 3.5mm headphones. The "boom" with the microphone can bend, letting you move it closer or farther from your mouth.The headset is very comfortable, with adjustable height and soft foam $T$phones. There are 3 buttons on the headset, a mute button and two others which I've never used. The mute button lights up red when muted.Overall, for ~$30, which is about how much I paid retail and the current price on amazon, it isn't the cheapest USB headset, but if you need something good, it's worth it.

I bought this headset because I had 3 logitech headsets short out on me all in less then 12 weeks. I have not had this long enough to know how it will last so I will just talk about what I have noticed. It is light weight, and can be worn for hours without bothering me. The mic works very well. The sound is so so, could be better could be worse. The controls are the same could be better could be worse honestly I prefer controls on the $T$, but only Plantrinics I saw with this was noice canceling which I do not want. Overall very good for the price I would easily suggest this headset for anyone looking for an under $50.00 headset.

Let me start off by saying, I bought the 626 in a store a y$T$ ago and paid almost $20 more than Amazon is currently listing it at, and I still think it was a great deal. I use my headset for a lot of stuff, recording and editing audio and video, skypeing, gaming and online graduate courses and this has been so much better than my previous head set. I'm comfortable with technology but not really what you'd call a techie.  But from a layman's perspective, I sort of see technology like wine, in that you're likely to notice the quality increase between a $12 and $25 bottle more than you would between a $25 and $50 bottle. I jumped from basic head-set ($20-$25 range) to the 626's range (I paid in the $40s). While the sound was a big improvement, the quality of my output for recording jumped 10-fold. Comfortable, simple and easy to interface with, this was worth the extra $20 for sure.  At this price I'm tempted to buy a second one for my laptop. If there is any negative it's very small, I wish the volume buttons were marked better, I'm always decreasing volume when I mean to increase and visa-versa.

With the Plantronics name you would expect this microphone and headset combo to produce good quality sound and it does deliver. The sound is cl$T$ and easy to understand what others are saying and the person your talking to can h$T$ you cl$T$ly as well. Installation on my computer was a snap. Basically I plugged it in and my Mac found it and started using it right away without any trouble. My only dislike on the product is level of comfort. A previous Plantronics headset I had the headphone speakers were able to flex and move a bit adjusting to the angle of your $T$s so it was equal pressure all around. This headset does not allow for that (headphone part is attached directly to the band) so its not n$T$ly as comfortable to use for extended periods of time. This might be okay if it was an over the $T$ design but since it sits directly on the $T$ and has little padding it gets annoying quickly. If you intend on using these for more than short periods of time or daily I would step up to a better model that offers a bit more comfort.

I purchased this headset to replace a logitech headset that broke after one month of use. The sound quality is better and the noise canceling more effective then any other headsets in this price range I've owned(and its been many). The $T$ cushions are a solid piece, not the ring style on most headsets I've encountered, which I fins more comfortable. There are reviews stating that they fins this item uncomfortable. I w$T$ a headset about 9 hours a day for work as well as other computer apps at home, and I've experienced no discomfort with this model.The headset also expands to the largest size of any headset I've experienced, a huge plus if you have a large head.

They sound nice and cl$T$ and the mic sounds good. I found them to be reasonably comfortable. But, I bought these for call center work and the soft phone system we use requires a USB headset with a little more gain to sound loud enough, even with the computer and headset volume controls all the way up. These don't block out external noise very well, making the weak audio an even bigger problem. I'm saving these as an emergency spare and dreading the day I'll have to use them and not be able to h$T$ my customers again... lol. I am still using Windows XP. I've been told the newer operating systems use different drivers and settings for USB audio devices and more gain may be possible.These did work excellent in other applications where the audio wasn't weak. I'm now using the Plantronics 655, which does have a little more gain and they block out more external noise.

Starting with the package, it was VERY hard to open.  I used scissors, but they went dull after finally getting it open.  And the plastic is very sharp once you finally do get it open. The headphones are worthless.  The $T$ pieces are small, and they don't lie flat against the $T$s so it's impossible to get good sound out of it.  I really regret buying these, and I looked a long time before finding ones that I wanted.

I bought this headset for use with my Rosetta Stone language software program and for music. I wanted good sound quality without a compromise in the microphone quality. I also demand comfort.I've had two headsets prior to my purchase of the Plantronics Audio 626. One of them did not have good mic quality. The likely reason for this is that it was not USB. If you want good microphone quality, you absolutely need to buy a headset with USB connection. This is because USB headsets are electronic to electronic sound signals. I can't get any more technical than that but if you want to know more about why USB connection is better, you can easily find articles on technology websites that will provide more details. Both of my previous headsets were uncomfortable for long periods. Actually, my first headset had very little padding.I began to wonder if I could ever find a comfortable, high quality headset that would fit my budget (I'm a college student). Every time I use this Plantronics Audio 626 I am amazed at what I got for my money. This kind of quality is worth well over $30!The sound is incredible for the price! I listened to many of my favorite songs to enjoy them again through these stereo-quality speakers. The guitar tones sound very cl$T$.The microphone works perfect for my Rosetta Stone software! (I also plan to use this for Skype and I am sure it will work very well.) The mic boom is well-designed. It swivels and bends. At first I didn't realize it bends because it feels so sturdy!On the cord there is a handy in-line control with three buttons. One raises the volume, one decreases the volume, and the other button mutes the microphone. The mute button glows red when the mute is on.Now for the COMFORT! This adjustable headband is very durable and yet very light! You hardly feel this headset on your head. It does not squeeze the head like one of my previous headsets. And the $T$pads are soft, blue foam. They feel very good on the $T$s and I think they actually help direct the sound into the $T$.Excellent product!

Awesome is definitely not the word I would have chosen to describe this product. First I would like to start off my review by making the statement I did not purchase this device from Amazon.com. I purchased this device from my local Best Buy. After the purchase I came home and res$T$ch Amazon.com and found that I could've bought the headset for about $15 cheaper at a price point of $29 as opposed to $45 in either case I feel that the $29 price point is more accurate to the quality of the headset. They do work for the intended purpose, but they lacked in comfort and fit and finish. For a $45 headset they just feel very cheap and not well made. But I don't want to speak all negatively about the headset there are some positive points the thing I did like most about the headset was on the USB cable there is a built in the mute button with two volume control buttons which work on PC as well as Mac.  The nice thing with the mute button is that it glows red when pushed so that you can tell that it's muted.This is a handy feature especially for my purposes with using this headset with Dragon dictation. I am possibly looking into getting a higher quality model of Plantronics headset through Amazon for the same cost I paid at Best Buy and return these to Best Buy

Unlike the 5 dollar headphones out there that sounded like an AM radio channel, this headphone is stereo for real!PLEASE PURCHASE FROM THE SELLER ORIONGADGETS, they sell genuine OEM headphones.I bought the headphone from some other company and the quality of music sounded so badly I had to ask for a refund and return it.I have been purchasing this model of headphone since last y$T$.The reason why I kept on purchasing it is because they break after several months of usage.But I still come back and purchase them due to the excellent sound quality at a relatively low price (probably why it breaks after several months).However, most $T$bud headphones won't last, either it is 5 dollars or 40 dollars, so it doesn't really matter with me.I usually order 2 or 3 at once, and that's one y$T$ supply of quality music for me.

They Came in mint condition just like the seller said. They matched the picture they came with something a little extra which was great. The headphones for LG RUMOR TOUCH came with little $T$ bud covers. It was a nice touch.. What they fail to state is that, the LG RUMOR TOUCH HEADPHONES are exactly the same as regular headphones just with the talk  button thing on it. The reason I even ordered the headphones was because I thought that it was going to have that tiny piece like other phone $T$ pieces. Other wise GREAT PRODUCT! If you have lots of music on your LG RUMOR TOUCH and want to listen to music and talk. :) 5 STAR!!!

I got these to use with my Droid 3. I have other handsfree devices in the car but wanted to try $T$buds with microphone. This works great. The microphone is imperceptible to the caller, The $T$buds have a perfect tone and are very comfortable. I highly recommend it. It's a wonderful solution to the handsfree problem at less than $2.00.

The strong point of these $T$phones are the fact that they are so comfortable and I have had them for over 2 months and they still feel like new....The sound quality is a mixed bag, it doesnt bring across bass very well and the music all around sounds kind of thin, but its not a deal breaker...some messing with teh EQ on my phone has helped with that....sound quality on voice calls are also excellent...and I am told I sound very cl$T$ as well

Pros:Fantastic sound for the price. Cl$T$ audio with strong bass performance.iPhone/Smartphone control (volume control only works with iPhone so far).Aesthetically pleasingAbove average sound isolationCons:Cord is rigid (not a positive), but doesn't app$T$ to be as durable as I would have hoped.Straight-style plug not ideal for my uses.While isolation is good, buds do not always stay put well in my $T$ (might be my $T$s' fault. I solved the problem by using the $T$ hooks that came with the SoundMagic PL-50's)Phone controls not easy to tell apart, as they're all flat and very close togetherFirst off, in my opinion, the pros outweigh the cons I wrote out for this product.  I was in the market for in-$T$ buds I could use for my iPhone that had volume control built in. That narrowed down my choices considerably.  I'm a fan of SoundMagic; I had purchased the SoundMagic PL-50 over a y$T$ ago, and the only way that product could have been better for me is if it had phone controls.  Although I do still prefer the overall sound clarity and signature of the PL-50 for everyday use, the E10M come close and produce a more &#34;fun&#34; signature that goes better with a lot of the rap/hip hop I listen to.  After a little burn in, the buds were ready to go and surprised me with the quality and clarity of sound at high volumes.  As a subway rider, the buds drown out most of the external noise as I can focus on either music or my talk show podcasts.I MUCH prefer the cord strength and texture of the PL-50 over the E10M.  I was hoping that the cord carried over to this model, but I was left disappointed.  They just don't feel as durable, and I question how well the cord will hold up long term. Also, after about a month of use, the cord still hasn't fully lost the curves left in it from the way it was packaged.  Its a minor annoyance, but I wasn't expecting the cord to be so rigid.  The buttons for phone and volume control are flat and hard to tell apart without looking. As I live in a cold weather location, perfect operation with gloves is almost impossible; I always need 2-4 tries until I hit the right button. Not a problem everyone would have, but I urge those of you with large fingers to look at products where the buttons are farther apart and more easily discernible.Overall, this is a good product. Build quality is great on the metal $T$bud casings, and I don't have any concerns about them breaking.  I'll give these guys a 4, but its really more of a 3.75 because of my annoyances. SoundMagic, if you're listening, please make an iPhone compatible version of the PL-50's where the volume and play buttons are farther apart!

These phones are OK and provide decent sound. I was hoping for a bit more bass and more crispness but I don't really have much to compare with other $40+ $T$buds. I tried them with every silicone and foam tips I could buy. Even those that provided the best fit still didn't overwhelm me. I'm tempted to try the Klipsch next time but not sure they would be a lot better. If anyone has a head to head comparison of these vs the Klipsch or Sony, I'd love to h$T$ it.Update:  I finally found a set of $T$ tips that work for me - triple silicone going from very small at the tip to larger. Seems to provide a better seal than anything I've tried to date. Now the bass is definitely better. I've upped my star rating to 4.

The sound quality is great and highly responsive to equalization. I have not been able to test the microphone. The carrying bag keeps them untangled and protected from other items in my pocket. The volume controls do not work for my galaxy s5 (the product is for iPhone), but I can use the pause/next/previous button.Note: There is not a fix for making the volume controls compatible with android, it is a proprietary feature of Apple and works entirely different than similar Samsung $T$buds.

I love the look and the fit. The only issue is how loud it rings in your $T$. You don't figure this out until your listening to music and the phone rings. The music level is fine but the phone ring actually hurts your $T$.

Did a decent job for me with three different phones at various times (a candy bar phone, a small slide-out keyboard phone, and an ancient clamshell with no camera that I sometimes carry when working in areas where cameras are not allowed). The problem that I had after 6 months (with this and several other previous cases of other styles and brands by the way) is that the belt $T$ is spring steel and riveted to a small plate buried in the case. The $T$ has a vinyl sleeve sewn over it. So first the sleeve gets cut up by the $T$ after a few months of normal use, and then the $T$ starts tearing out of the case itself after a few months.  Yet for the price, I don't feel too bad.The magnetic catch is fairly secure (seat belts on some car will open it and let the phone fall out though) and can be opened and closed very quietly when necessary, unlike velcro which is very secure or snaps which can wear out and be insecure and are sometimes noisy as well.I wish I could find a case like this for less than $100 wher the $T$ had smooth edges and the cover sleeve over it was more wear-resistant. Other changes to the construction would hep too, but that might be too much to expect from a bargain-basement product. I don't think I'll ever wear out the one my wife made for me, but I doubt she cold produce then economically for mass sale either.

I refurbed my old G1 for my wife. She's been eyeballing my smart phone for a while and I felt that instead of buying a new phone for an extreme amount of money and having to sign a new contract with T-Mobile it would be better to resurrect this old war horse and give it a new lease on life. The original $T$ had swollen beyond the ability of  the phone to contain and wouldn't hold a charge. I had looked at buying the OEM version of this $T$ a year ago and the cost then was just silly. This $T$ is identical to the original OEM and works just as expected. Fast shipping.

After an epic struggle with my old $T$, I came across this cheap but great $T$. I needed my G1 to last a few more months, and it helped a ton!

My old G1 died.  For it's time it was a cool phone.  I stuffed it in a drawer and forgot about it.  When I found it the other day I thought maybe it just need a $T$.

I assumed getting batteries directly from Amazon, LLC would make it more likely to get an HTC-manufactured $T$, but clearly I paid extra for nothing.  Both the first $T$ and the replacement were counterfeits with the same serial number and part number.  Quality seems low, as they were unable to maintain a stable charge and would cause the phone to randomly crash four or more times a day.  Avoid.

This $T$ could (and, for me, has) gone almost 2 full days without a charge, and I'm a power user. Throughout the day, I'm getting emails, surfing the web, my WiFi is always on (because I tend to move between multiple hotspots, and the majority of my surfing is done via WiFi), and I send/receive probably 20 texts through the day. When I get home, if I haven't plugged in all day, I'm still between 50%-70% $T$.The thing is, you need to condition this $T$ when your first get it. Because of its construction and the materials used, this needs to be done. The first 5-6 times you charge, you need to wait until the phone basically shuts off. I mean, literally wait until it powers down for lack of any $T$, or wait until it's at or under 5%. Then, charge it fully. After this is done 5-6 times, the overall lifetime of the $T$ will increase, and the phone will also report the $T$ level more accurately.Also, some things to keep in mind:* 3G/4G uses more power than WiFi. So, if the majority of your surfing/data is done via the former, you'll see bigger power drops than if you used WiFi.* GPS, Bluetooth, and WiFi can be easily and quickly turned off when you're not using them; this will help maximize your $T$ life. Lots of people just leave them on all the time, and don't think about it.All in all, I'm very glad I have this $T$.

This thing is lasting FOREVER! Only a few full charge cycles in but this $T$ is lasting all day and then some. Takes about 3 hours for a full charge with the phone on. Used Battery Doctor to assist with charging and monitoring the initial charge. What worked for me was a full uninterrupted charge, full drain x3. So far so good! 1800mAh > 1300mAh!

I purchased this for my T-Mobile G2.  In the beginning, I was very happy with it.  I thought it definitely increased the length of time I could use the phone.  But now, not quite 6 months later, the performance has fallen off a lot.  And it will not charge to 100%.  After charging all night, it is at 78% or 59%, or some partial level.  Now I have to look for another $T$.  That was not a long enough life for this expensive a $T$.

Well, my phone [Sanyo Zio by Kyocera] was turning itself off & when I would turn it back on, it would be completetly dead, no bars. So I decided to try out a new $T$, because atleast if I was out & my phone died, I'd have another $T$ to pop in.The packaging was nice, it came in a little bag through the mail. Overall, this was well worth the 7 bucks I paid. : }

Amazon keeps sending emails asking for a review so, OK. This is a $T$ and it fits in my phone. When I put it in the phone, the phone turns on so it must work. It didn't cost too much and came soon after I ordered it. I don't know how long it will last but I'm pretty sure I'll have a new Samsung Galaxy before I find out. If you have a Sanyo Zio phone that needs a $T$ I recommend this one, otherwise don't waste your money on a $T$ you have no use for.

Bought this $T$ to replace the original $T$ in our Sanyo &#34;smart&#34; phone.  Phone was acting up, overheating, freezing up and generally not working very well.  It was suggested that maybe the $T$ was bad, so we tried this one to replace it.  The $T$ took a charge fine, but the problems with the phone persisted.  Apparently, it was not so much a $T$ issue as a &#34;this is an old phone that really just needs to be replaced&#34; issue.If you have an old Kyocera/Sanyo ZIO phone - and you actually LIKE it - this could be the $T$ for you.  The solution for us?  Get a new phone.Problem solved.

It is what it is... a $T$ for the Kyocera Zio. It looked exactly like the one that came in my wife's phone (actually Kyocera-branded and not Sanyo-branded like the one in the photos). We put it in, charged it up, and now her phone works again. I ponied up for the quicker shipping, and it came when it was supposed to. Even with expedited shipping, it was a third the price I could have gotten it for locally (plus, I'm not sure anyone in town had it in stock... some store would have had to special-order it for me anyway!)UPDATE: Bought the $T$ in July, and in December the phone is having trouble again. The phone's original $T$ didn't last forever, but it did last longer than 5 months.

Although it was just a $T$, it did serve its purpose. The only downside was the the phone. Previously I had different batteries and they all worked but eventually did not charge. I am just going to assume it has to be a phone issue, because the same happened to this $T$. The $T$ shipped from the east coast standard mail delivery and I received it within 3 business days.

Bafter works very well. as most people, my days are very long. With this $T$, I dont have to worry about charging in the middle of the day. The only drawback I see is....

The ear pieces are larger than typical headphones, so beware if you have a small ear opening.  Other than that, the $T$ is very good for phone conversations and listening to music on the Samsung Impression.  It seems fairly durable so far.The cord connecting one earphone is longer than the other, to allow the microphone to hang closer to the left shoulder.  The overall cord is adequately long.

I purchased these a while ago, and still have all the sets I purchased. I use them on occasion, but not all the time. I have recently purchased the Motorola Wireless Bluetooth headphones, (Model S305,) and I'm so impress with the $T$, I will probably never use these headphones again, mainly because they have a wire attached, and the jack on my phone only allows for either a headphone OR a charger, but not both.Nice price - and they do work well if you don't mind the wire!

I'm 6'2" tall and weigh 195 pounds. These things are too big to fit comfortably in my ears. I can't quite get them in, so it always feels like they're falling out. A competing set costs a little more and does not include a microphone, but you can use the phone's mic for that. The sound $T$ for the competing set is great and the ear plugs fit comfortably in my average sized ears. You could just take the chance that your ear canals are big enough. If you don't need the extra microphone, however, I recommend the Samsung Samsung R610 SCH-R610 Propel I627 SGH-I627 i908 Omnia SGH-i908 T659 SGH-t659 A517 SGH-A517 Black OEM Cell Phone Handsfree AAEP435SBE AAEP485MBE.

Do you have a myTouch 3G? Or a Droid Eris? Or any phone that has that strange looking USB input? This product caters to your misfortune. Not only does it charge your phone, it has speakers that are good. I've never used the mic part of it, but the speakers function really well. My myTouch is over-the-hill at this point and I don't expect it to survive through the winter, but I can't blame the rock dock for it. I played "I Go Hard in the Paint" for 2 hours on repeat in a Vegas hotel room last weekend and no one complained about the sound $T$.

I'm not an audiophile. I can't tell you anything about the $T$ of the sound, other than to say I've never noticed a problem.I like the all-white look of these headphones. I've had them 2 months and they still look nice, although the foam in the ear cups has begun to yellow.It was really important to have in-line volume control, because my coworkers will start talking to me before I have a chance to open up iTunes and click on the pause button. "WAIT WHAT, I DIDN'T HEAR THAT!" With this, I can flick the audio off in half a second.I have had to return headphones before for squeezing my head too tightly. These however are fine once you stretch them out a bit.However, for me there's a limit to how long I can wear any headphones / earbuds, and this is no different. After about 2 hours my head needs to take a break.Are these high end headphones? No. But they are attractive and functional.

One of my biggest let downs this year....I purchased these headphones based on its growing popularity within Apple's Online Store. I decided to get it on Amazon because it offered the "White" model which I wanted. Upon receiving the package, I was excited about adding another headphone to my collection. At this price point, I was hoping for a pair that I can wear casually, meanwhile keeping my Audio Technica ATH-M50 and Dr. Dre Beats at home for other purposes.On the first try, I wanted to log on Amazon right away and give it 2-3 stars, but I decided to wear it for a couple weeks as well as run some unbiased experiments to give it a better feedback. Turns out, there was nothing that can justify this as a better pair of headphones than its competitors.I compared this to a $130 pair of ATH-M50s, $20 pair of Apple Earphones, and another pair of headphones. Final conclusion? In terms of performance, it gives a clear, colorful sound which allows you to hear both the high/low levels. However, I did expect more. When you compare these to Apple's stock OEM earphones, the $T$ is just about the same. Urbanears products however gives with these earpads that really do keep sound out. This helps. For a pair of $50-60 headphones, I think this is average but not good enough for me to not want to reach $30-40 more to get a pair of Sony's or cheaper Audio Technica's.Let's chat about comfort which destroyed the excitement for me. It's just too damn tight. I think I have an average size head (maybe slightly bigger?). Either way I've had several folks, all smaller than me, try on the headphones. Even when you have the headphones around your neck, it feels like the headphone is trying to actively strangle you to death. This easily slapped a star and a half off this product for me (the other half a star comes from the disappointment in terms of performance, okay but not good enough).The product was beautifully packaged and I really like the way Urbanears is going. If the headphones fit better, I would've given it 4 stars but I can't see myself wearing these much in the future. I'm slightly disappointed but think these will fit many people in terms of performance and expectation for its price range. I've worn them the past 5 minutes while writing this review and already my ears are beginning to hurt. I do hope I can come back a couple months from now and add a star but for now, the discomfort and mediocre performance will keep it at a 3.

I uses these quite a lot and love them. The fit is good and the sound is very full and rich. The overall feel of the headphones is exceptional as it just feels like $T$ manufacturing. This feeling includes the cable which is cloth covered so does not tangle. Overall I have the intent to look at other products from this company.

These are simply amazing headphones. they are extremely durable, even when folded up. I've shoved them in my backpack dozens of times, and they're completely fine. The remote works better than those of the Apple earbuds, and is much more comfortable and easier to press. Noise cancellation is great and the ear cushions are very comfortable. Sound $T$ is absolutely spectacular. You can turn them up realllllly loud and still have it not hurt because they're over-the-ear. This results in great sound balance because you don't get cymbal and treble crashes directly in your ear canal. As far as bass goes, these are the best headphones in their class and price range. When turned up to max volume they can even be used as around-the-neck speakers :p  If you're looking for over-the-ear, great sound $T$, durability, and surprising affordability, then look no further than Urbanears Plattan. Everything else is either crappy, or severely overpriced.

I was skeptical if this tiny mic would perform well. After making a few tests, I was nothing less than amazed at the $T$ of this little thing. It really produces quite an astonishing sound either up close or recording lectures. It does however pick up ALL room noise. So if you're recording yourself or others speaking, you should record in a fairly quiet room, maybe one with carpeting. The only thing I find a little unfortunate is that it does not have a input volume control. So recording loud live music could easily distort. But, for the money and the results, it's well worth it. I wish someone would come out with an adapter for the iPod Touch 2G so we can plug a regular microphone in and adjust input volume.

Purchased the little pill-cap for my iPod touch to record class lectures and meetings I didn't want to take notes at.  Good $T$ mike for such a small little piece.  I had to put it on a tiny lanyard because it literally looks like a pill when you close it up ---- and I've almost lost it a few times!  But as far as its size, convenience and performance, its great for what I use it for.

Perfect. This is a really convenient microphone with good $T$ for doing voice recordings in meetings, which is what I use it for. It's tiny size makes it more useable than most I've used, and it's simple to sue on my iPods - just plug it in and record using the iPod inbuilt software.

I found the sound $T$ to be much better than my bluetooth headset, but the piece wouldn't stay in my ear. I tried the different sizes sent with the headset but found that the piece would fall out after a few minutes of use. Great for short phone calls but not long conversations.

I purchased this headset to be used with my blackberry curve. It works well enough as a headset and I would rate the wound $T$ on both ends as average (about the same as the standard headset that came with my phone). My complaints are more on the interface and experience rather than sound.First, the fit was not great. I love in-ear headsets and have been using different style in-ear headsets and headphones for many years. This is the principle reason that I purchased this headset for my phone. That said, the angle of the headset insert and bulk of the speaker box were such that I had some difficulty getting a good fit. It would insert into the ear canal fine, but had trouble staying in place. I tried different sized ear tips to no avail.Also, the ear tips have a tendency to fall off this headset. As you may know, this is common for in-ear style headset and headphones, but from my experience it was excessive with this headset. I lost several ear tips in a short while using these. Luckily I  have several spare ear tips and was able to use some of these otherwise that headset would have been useless within a couple days.Lastly, the cord is very thin. I did not get the sense it was particularly fragile, but it was very textured and had a tendency to snag on everything. I use my headset in the car a lot and it was constantly catching on my steering wheel, hand brake, arms, clothes, you name it. And every time it got snapped it popped off my ear.Summary: this headset works, I just prefer a different aesthetic.

This headset is better than what you'd expect for $6.  It doesn't fit my ear very well and I had to attach a rubber band to make it stay on.  But it works.  I have an LG Vu Plus GR700 phone and its bluetooth tranceiver is very poor.  I've tried pairing it with expensive, high $T$ bluetooth ear pieces but people constantly complain they cannot hear my voice.  So I abandoned bluetooth and went to a wired headset. Unfortunately, the GR700 has no dedicated headset jack, only a micro USB port, so I needed a headset with a micro USB jack and those are quite rare.  This headset has a micro USB jack and now people can hear me.

This is a mid-century telephone handset redesigned and sleeked out in several hot colors and coated with silky smooth silicone so that it is ultra-comfortable to hold. At the end of its springy coiled cord is a 3.5mm jack that fits the iPhone and several other mobile phones. No more holding the mobile phone up to your face, just place it on your desk pick up the handset and think 1960! As a bonus, anyone who is worried about possible radiation from mobile phones can breathe a sigh of relief. I think that design wise, this handset is gorgeous. The sound $T$ is superb and the looks you'll get from others will be priceless. I'm having great time, reminiscing with this. I am sure you will as well!

I purchased this item to make lengthy cellphone conversations more comfortable, and so it is obvious when I am talking on the phone. The concept of the Pop Phone has potential, this product comes up short for two reasons:  Priamarily because this sound $T$ is poor.  I had listeners ask me if I was talking on a speaker phone because the sound was echoing.  Secondarily the cord is too short to place the cellphone on a desk and hold the handset to one's ear. I no longer use my Pop Phone.

The good: The battery is small and light.  The less then optimal: The battery pack does not provide much extra power.  Reviews for this product (on Amazon and elsewhere) report it provides about 70-75% additional battery life.  In 2 uses of this with my iPhone 4S, it only provided 15%-20% increase in battery power.  The 15% was after the battery pack had sat about a week after being charged.  The 20% was after the battery pack had been just removed from the charger and said it was fully charged.  While I like Griffin products and generally find them to be of better than average $T$, I think this product is a bit too expensive for the additional power it provides.

Very disappointed with the product. I had been using a Jawbone, but lost it. I decided to try something else since the Jawbone was the most expensive option where I was shopping (BestBuy iirc) and I liked the necklace-strap that comes with it, which I thought would be useful and reduce the chances of my misplacing this one as I had done with the Jawbone. Big miskake - the sound quality is very poor (lots of complaints from callers who never complained when I was using the Jawbone) - it's especially bad if you are outside and there is any wind, a condition under which the Jawbone performed well. I've also had two of the three earbuds that came with the headset just fall off over the course of the day, leaving me one ill-$T$ting set away from needing to acquire replacements. Further, the strap is about an inch too short to reach comfortably to my ear when around my neck. When the last earbud inevitably falls off, I'll go back to a Jawbone or try another option after asking around.

I really like these earbuds. The sound quality is excellent and their placement at the vestibule of the auditory canal allows me to hear environmental sounds as well as those issuing from my phone or other program source. If I keep the volume down, I can drive safely while playing my GPS through them. The plug type phones, which completely occlude the auditory canal would not allow me to do that.Still, like any product, earbuds have their limitations. They don't cancel extraneous noises and so aren't great for listening to quiet music in crowded or noisy surroundings.  The only thing I would add to this item is a $T$.  The reason that I didn't get the $T$ model is that it is designed specifically with the iPhone in mind and may not work with my Samsung/Android phone.

I bought 2 of these both for my samsung flight.  1st one angled 90 degrees down and 2nd one angled up.  1st one I got is still in one piece and works well.  2nd one I got broke apart when I dropped my phone.  Well phone dangled thanks to the adapter, but the casing for $T$ fell apart.  I was able to put it together but it came apart again and the button to answer the phone disappeared.  But I was still able to use the adapter without the button.  I doubt that anyone'll need this anymore since almost all the new phones I see have both stereo adapter and micro usb.  Samsung Flight for some reason they decided to try without 3.5 stereo plug.

I purchased this adapter so I could listen to music on my SPH-M520 from Sprint. I don't subscribe to power vision, so my music is accessible only under "mass storage". Slightly inconvenient but it works. The adapter works well, the sound quality is great on my Bose headphones. The reason I only give it 4 stars is the length of the adapter. I would have preferred Samsung just leave the $T$ off and shorten the cable. One other slight problem is a noticeable hissing in the headphones when flipping through menus. It seems to go away however when listening to music. Overall solid product, recommended.

Pros: Light and comfortable, very good microphone clarity, good earpiece $T$.Con: Somewhat difficult to wear; no earpiece volume amplification and microphone mute button.I purchased a Plantronics MX153-M1 (for $22 at an family-run electronics store a few blocks away from J&R; Music and Computer World), the version of the MX150 made specifically for Motorola phones - v60, v70, v120, T720 and later phones. The MX153-M1 adds a push-button towards the upper-middle of its cord that enables the headset wearer to dial the last-dialed number, use voice-activated dialing, answer calls, and end calls without touching the phone. The MX153-N1 and MX153-N3 are push-button versions of the MX150 for Nokia phones. The base MX150 itself does not have the push-button and associated functionality.The MX150's earbud is anchored to the wearer's ear by a soft rubber grip that wraps under and essentially clips the earlobe (pinna). It takes several seconds to fit the earbud and pivot the microphone boom to their proper angles; this must be done each time the wearer puts on the headset. The disadvantage of this fitting requirement is that if you are not already wearing the headset when your phone starts ringing, you are better off answering your phone the old-fashion way. Once fitted however, the MX150 is light and comfortable to point of being unnoticeable. The MX150's FlexGrip design (shared by the Plantronics MX100 family) is better than ear-loop designs that can get in the way of eyeglasses and sunglasses; headband designs that can pull on the wearer's hair; and classic earbud designs that can easily fall off. People with earrings may not be comfortable with the MX150 because of its grip on the ear's pinna.In contrast to generic headset microphones that often make the wearer $T$ distant, the MX150's microphone performance is very good and makes the wearer $T$ clear and close to the phone. The noice-cancelling microphone does a good job of eliminating ambient noise - even inside a moving New York City subway car. The MX150 family does not have microphone volume control and microphone mute functions.Earpiece performance is good. The MX150 lacks earpiece volume control, relying instead on the phone's volume control functions. As with any headset design lacking self-powered earpiece volume amplification, ambient noise may be an issue in open or noisy environments, e.g. a busy New York City street or subway car.The MX150's price competition is with the Jabra ProBoom. The latter has battery-powered earpiece volume amplification, but consumers should carefully weigh this great advantage against the MX150's fit and weight benefits. The two competitors also differ in push-button support. The MX150 family has push-button models for Motorola and Nokia phones, while the ProBoom family has push-button models for Nokia and Samsung phones.Of the three Plantronics headsets that I have purchased (the other two being the M175 and M100), the MX153-M1 is the best one that I have yet used.

I ordered these after i found out that my motorola backflip does not come with headphones. wtf?! i know right. anyways i hit google and found out that motorola sold these as separate accessories (the tmobile cliq has them included) i so i searched amazon and came across these, knowing they were originals from factory they probably had an okay $T$ type, and over all performance. Wrong. they have awesome $T$, bass is deep and reach (beyonce video phone playing lol) microphone is awesome and located in the right position. people said i $T$ed clear and with no background noise. shipping was super fast ordered the 11th of june got them the 14 of june, and that because the weekend got in the way of shipping. i highly recommend for anybody looking for headphones with a mic, i gonna order more for my wife and 2 kids we all have the same phones. And they come with an adapter for the 2.5mm phones. im so pleased with these.

The Motorola S205 Stereo ear buds work well enough... they were the least expensive units of their type on Amazon so I thought to try them.The fact is they're cheap. The design's poor (the buds don't fit into small ear canals) the wiring is very small (susceptible to damage easily) and they aren't the classiest looking $T$ devices.They are however: inexpensive (with quick delivery from Justpal), light weight, easy to store in pockets, have great bass response, and work fairly well with all the systems I've tried them on (Droid, PC, IPod....). I originally purchased the buds to see if they would fit my lifestyle--and they do. So, if an inexpensive test is what you're after these will work. But, for extended use they're not very comfortable. I'll be looking for a pair of more comfortable buds in the future.

The ear buds are a little big, but I felt the $T$s was very good and they require a lot less volume from whatever device you are using to be very loud. The button works, but the clicking isn't very satisfying or crisp. If you really want the good stuff, you have to get one that goes into the ear canal, but I can't stand those. These are one of the best ones of the non-canal ones that I have found.

Motorola's website lists several handsfree headsets with mini-USB jacks as being compatible with the Motorola Atrix. They aren't. I bought this model and it works great for calls.

I bought three of these so I could have one everywhere. I have been frustrated with Bluetooth with disconnecting and having to recharge them all the time. These were very inexpensive so I have one at my office desk, home and 2 in the car. The $T$ quality isn't the best so if you listen to a lot of music you might chose something else. I use them mostly for talking on the phone and they work pretty good.

great for phone use and the mic is very sensitive, not for regular headphone use though. The earbuds slip out a lot and they $T$ hollow so $T$ quality is low. Also mine broke after a couple of months, but I liked them enough to buy the same brand, they were cheap anyway.great for blackberry storm

Cute, but annoying. when the cord splits into two wires, one is long and the other is short, and so one keeps getting pulled out of my ear. They don't stay in my ear very well, and they feel weird in there. But MOST IMPORTANTLY the $T$ doesn't work right in one earbud. The volume seems normal on one side, but super quiet on the other. This happened after very few uses. I bought a new set now and I'm not looking back.

I purchased this for use with a Samsung A687 hoping for better $T$ than I was getting with a fairly expensive bluetooth device.  I'm very pleased.  Telephone conversations are crystal clear, the volume is good, and the other parties indicate that they hear me as clearly as if it were a landline (no distracting ambient noise like the other device was apparently picking up).The cord is approximately 40 inches long from the plug to the mic (where the line splits off to each ear bud).  It reaches below your knees if you're wearing the headset, so plenty long enough for normal use.Although I don't use the phone to listen to music, I did try it with this product and the $T$ was acceptable -- way better than I expected given the price.

They're good if you're deaf not because they're particularly loud. It's just that deaf people wouldn't be able to tell the difference between the atrocious $T$ quality of these headphones and that of others, even ones that are similarly priced!

The Motorola H350 bluetooth headset is one of the cheaper models out there, and it shows.PAIRINGThe H350 pairs like most bluetooth headsets.  Tell your phone to search for headsets, then hold down the H350 main button for about 10 seconds.  Your phone finds the H350 and you hit "ok."  This works as expected and is no different from any other bluetooth headset.  I've used this headset with my Motorola RAZR and Uniden landline bluetooth-capable phone.COMFORT/DESIGNThe H350 has an earclip that easily pops off so that you can fit the headset onto either ear.  The clip itself is flexible rubber and while it seems moderately comfortable at first, I find my ear starts to hurt after about 30 minutes.  Ideally, I do not want to notice or feel that I'm wearing a headset.  I definitely cannot say that about the H350.  The speaker lightly rests over your ear canal.  There are two $T$ buttons on the top and bottom of the headset to increase, decrease, or mute the speaker.SOUND QUALITYI've tried quite a few headsets out there from Plantronics, Motorola and Jabra to compare.  Most of them have some deficiencies, and the H350 is no different.  People on the other end of my conversations state that while my voice is clear, it sounds a little "far-away."  I also think that the highest $T$ ability of the H350 speaker on my end is still too weak (yes, I have perfectly normal hearing).  When you max out the speaker $T$ the sound becomes a bit distorted and it's still not loud enough to clearly hear the other caller while driving in a car, even with the windows all the way up.  This is in stark contrast to the Plantronics 640-665 series which have jelly earpieces that comfortably squish into your ear canal for optimal $T$ and clarity.  As a result, I can only recommend the H350 for home use where there isn't alot of background noise present.OVERALLAt it's basic level, the Motorola H350 bluetooth headset works.  You maintain a good connection between it and your phone within 10-12 feet (like any other functional headset).  However, it's shortcomings in $T$ and mic quality cannot be overlooked.  I only recommend this headset if you plan on using it at home or in the office, and only if you got it for a great price.  If you need higher quality, you may want to open your wallet a little more and look into that Plantronics 640-665 line.

The performance of this headset is disappointing. I originally ordered it because my Moto headset (HS850) seemed to have low $T$ when used with the Blackberry 8830 (the HS850 didn't have this problem when used with a Moto V710 phone). I figured since the HS 655 was optimized for Blackberry by Plantronics, it would be the best choice. Reviews rated the Plantronics version highly. My experience: Comfort and fit was fine. Features and operation also fine, although it lacks the ability to switch between calls during Call Waiting. Volume for me was excellent (solved my original problem) but people consistently complained about the sound quality on their end - lots of noise, static, etc. The headset was never more than about 2 feet from the phone (same side of body) so range wasn't the problem. I called my own office voicemail to record the sound quality from various locations during my commute and confirmed the poor performance. Switching back to the Moto HS850 got rid of the problem, so I figure the phone is ok.This one's going back. Maybe it's just a defective unit, but I'm done with this model. The hunt for a decent Bluetooth headset continues...**UPDATE**I ordered a Plantronics Voyager 510 based on the high marks so many reviewers gave it. It had the same noise problem as the HS 655 (crackles, etc) on the receiver's end when paired with the Blackberry 8830! Now I figured the phone was at fault. After playing with a couple of settings, I found that the encryption setting was causing the problem (Bluetooth setup -> highlight the device ->select "Device Properties" -> set Encryption to "Disabled"). With encryption disabled, the problem is gone. So probably the HS 655 was fine all along. The 510 may still be a better choice since it has a noise cancelling microphone while the 655 does not, but the style is definitely "old school."(It's puzzling that RIM didn't make sure the HS 655 was fully compatible with their own phone, or at least put something in the headset instructions to disable the encryption feature. Then again, they had really poor documentation that came with the product: a quick start guide that didn't even describe how to change ear buds (3 sizes provided) or how to mount the ear clip that came in the package. They did have a card that directed you to their website for more info, but there wasn't anything more descriptive there either. I had to go to Plantronics web site to get the more complete user guide for their 655.)

received the Blackberry HS 655 shortly after ordering it online, at a great price by the way..good packaging, came with the instruction pamphlet including charging directions and device functionality.i read thru those materials and charged it overnight.Been using this product for about a month, every day. I have been using Blackberry phones for about 5 years now and this HS 655 is far and away the best Bluetooth headshet I have used.3 ear pieces came in the packge. I selected one that fits my ear very comfortably. easy instructions to enable as Bluetooth with my phone. worked the first time through.very lightweight, hardly noticeable in the ear. I keep it in my ear for extended periods of time throughout the day as I drive around the city. 3 hours long is not uncommon.Reception is clear, "crystal"!! clear!a soft impress answers the phone and ends the conversation. $T$ adjustments work very well. I keep the case clipped to my pants pocket at times so that way it is handy for storgage when not in my ear.Having used as many as 1/2 dozen other headsets over the last few years, nothing compares to this one...I did initial researach on the Internet to check out other reviews and the consensus of the product.It definitely meets and exceeds my expectations!!Blackberry did "good" with this one..I highly recommend it for other Blackberry users. small,lightweight, comfortable, and terrific reception!!

I use this product daily. The $T$ control is amazing. I have issues hearing certain tone levels, and this is the first headset (I have tried 4 previously) that has enough $T$ so that I can hear any caller, regardless of the tone level in their voice. The gel earpieces are very comfortable as well. Very reliable product.

I have a bit of problem hearing these things so I was pleasantly surprised at the  listening $T$ of the HS 655.I've owned Motorola, Sony-Erricson, Jabra and Cardo-Scala headset, they are all sitting in  my desk drawer, collecting dust. They were just too quiet.Another nice feature is the charger is the same fitting as my RZR, a mini USB.

I tried one for a little over a week.  I wanted something that I could use in my car for hands free.  Pairing with my blackberry 8830 was easy.  Although I wasn't interested in the earbud I can safely say is too large to use in your ear.  Speaker was clear but $T$ was a bit too loud, easily fixed with the buttons, but unfortunately it doesn't retain the $T$ settings when you switch it off.  Someone noted that the buttons are a bit too close together and impossible to see at night - I completely concur.  The microphone worked pretty well - most people said they could hear me clearly but with the obvious speakerphone sound.  I ended up returning it for two reasons: 1) the battery life was not very good.  A few days of of may be 3 hours total usage and it needed to be recharged.  2) I ended up hanging up calls and making calls because pressing the buttons was problematic.

Edited after one week!I have been using this product for about a week. The ear piece is not comfortable, nor does it have good sound quality. As a matter of fact I can not hear the conversation because the $T$ is so very low. I really can not recommend it and will return it asap.I received the LG HBM-800 Bluetooth Mono Headset with Speakerphone and Charging Cradle this afternoon. It paired and connected almost instantly. I have a couple of concerns after using it for only a few hours. First is that the earpiece is not very comfortable. It wasn't that it really hurt or made my ear feel raw but, it did bother me enough that I caught myself adjusting it time and time again. I will try it for a few days but may try to return it. Second is the clip on the ear piece. With the clip attached it will not slide into the visor hands free unit. You must first pull the clip off. Since it is plastic as well as the part it slides onto, i wonder how long it will last if I try to remove and replace it frequently. If either part breaks it will be garbage. Third is the visor clip. It is very flimsy plastic and attaches to the back of the unit by 1/4 turn lock. Again if this breaks it will make the unit much less convenient to use.These concerns aside, the sound quality is great. The people that I have spoken with did not realize that I was on a headset or a speaker phone, even with the drivers side window in my truck halfway down. The blue-tooth strength is more than adequate and allows me to leave my phone on my dresser with my keys and walk anywhere in the house, even the backyard while I am grilling. This is the first headset that has allowed me to use the voice command feature on my phone, (Samsung Captivate), with the headset. I have tried three other headsets and the blue-tooth in my other car but the voice command feature did not work. I found this very impressive.I read several reviews before purchasing this. I understood some of the possible flaws and decided to chance it anyway. I found the design faults that others had reported to be not so much of a problem and even a plus in some cases. The turn on/off issue reported by several reviews makes perfect sense to me. If you were to leave it on all of the time you would constantly have a dead battery. Most vehicles have a utility plug that the power shuts off on when the vehicle is turned off, so even if you were to leave it plugged in all of the time you would have the same problem. I use the ear piece all of the time and place it in the desktop charger overnight and don't bother turning it off at all. So yes I do have to turn the speakerphone on/off every time I get in or out of the car but I don't mind the second or two it takes to do it.The package contains everything needed to use both devices together or separately. A desktop charger for the earpiece, power cord for the speakerphone, and car charger that fits both. For the price I feel that it is a great product. Now if it will just last me a year it will have been totally worth the small expense.

The case is billed as $T$ting an Atrix 4G MB860.  It does not $T$ the larger Atrix HD.  Attempts to contact the company to replace it with one that would $T$ have failed to date, in spite of emails direct to the company and thru Amazon.  I'm upset because the case looks great.  Would love to find one that works.

I bought this belt clip to move the phone from my pocket to my belt.  The phone $T$s fine despite me using this protective case from TPU:  [....]The magnetic flap is great, sort of closes on it's own once it's close enough.  The horizontal positioning is great as it allows for more movement vs a vertical case.  Overall a great buy for the Atrix.

I ordered this case with the *Rubberized Shield Hard Case - Hot Pink (Free HandHelditems Sketch Universal Stylus Pen)*  I was wondering if the case would $T$ with the snap-on case installed on the Atrix, and if it didn't at least it was cheap. But they both $T$ perfectly inside this case. It protects the phone really well inside my purse and from drops. I don't use the belt clip feature but it is there for anyone that would. I would recommend this to any Atrix lover &lt;3

I ordered the "GTMax Black Horizontal Large Slim Leather Pouch Case with Belt Clip for AT&T; Motorola Atrix 4G MB860" from CrazyOnDigital first then they shipped me the wrong case. Shipped it back on my dime. Then brought another one from electromaster, they sent me the wrong one called Luxmo case. Fortunately it $T$ my Motorola Atrix w/ Otter Box Commuter. So I'm happy.So really I can't tell you anything, since two vendors sent the wrong case. So that tells you that you order at your own risk, and hope they send you the right one.

This case was so inexpensive I was concerned that it might not be good quality.  I am glad to say my concerns were not justified.  The case is well made, from quality leather, it has a good magnet to hold it shut and the phone $T$s perfectly.  It's exactly what I was looking for at a great price.

This pouch is something I needed for work since I have to wear a duty belt and have no room for a bulky phone like mine in my pocket. This pouch exceeded my expectations by 100%! I expect something so inexpensive purchased from Amazon to be cheap, flimsy and poor quality but this thing is great! I use an Otterbox Commuter case on my Atrix so I thought I'd have to remove it to get my phone to $T$ in this pouch but it $T$s perfectly with the Otterbox. I imagine it may be slightly too big for just the phone but it is pretty close.

This case was supposed to $T$ with a tight skin on. If you want to use a skin, then this case will not $T$. I bought the TPU soft gel case cover and with it on, you cannot use this case.

I received this case on time and in good packaging from the seller.  It is a good $T$ for my Motorola Atrix 4G phone.  I use a gel case too, so it is a little tight which is ok considering.

The cover $T$s well and the holes line up perfectly.  Like the slightly rubberized feel since the phone is a bit slippery otherwise.

I got one of these for my tracfone, hoping too be able to see it more easily in the depths of my bag. When my sister bought the same phone for herself  I recently,I could see her having similar problems-black phone in black purse disappears from sight. So I looked for a bright color protector for her. She loves the color, and likes the way the case systems to protect her phone, giving her a better grip on it.I have only one complaint. This newer cover does not $T$ as snugly and seems to be a bit carelessly constructed compared with my older cover on my phone. We had to carve out the opening for the charge port and there is a crack along  side of her case where the  front and back pieces come together. We carved, and all seems  to work well enough for now.

This case had good solid concept but it fails in a couple of areas. First the screen protector is horrible especially on the Samsung Infuse which has an awesome screen. The screen protector give an almost unbearable experience by producing a grainy display making text hard to read even on the Infuse 4.5 inch screen. This case also comes with a rubber outer cover that mainly covers the corners and its function is to absorb impact. It also difficult for this product to stay affixed as it has little tabs that are suppose to fit inside the main case. I never use this outer cover becuase this case add substantial bulk. The main case which I believe most use is functional by giving access to all the phones buttons and ports. I have noticed that the bottom portion of this case by the charging port lacks clips so the case has a bowing effect which has affected the screen protector by lifting it from screen. My remedy was removing the screen protector (held by glue very easy to remove) which gave me two advantages a viewable screen and function of my bottom physical keys. The case use to fit and snap together tightly but are a couple of month of owning it and only removing a handful of times it has not stayed snapped together after a two foot fall. I has high hopes for this case but it has some $T$ flaws that has made it fail. I believe this case should last the life of your phone which for most is every two years; not two months especially at the premium it sells for.

I do a lot of web surfing with my Blackberry, which drains my battery.  This extra battery is an OEM product, new condition, and is perfect.  I keep it charged and toss it in my bag when I travel or will be away from charging sources for extended periods of time.  I also live in a colder climate where travel can be challenging and we're always advised to keep a full tank of gas and a fully charged cell phone if we travel during difficult weather.  I do have a car $T$ as well as charging/sync cables, but find the extra battery is a great comfort for a very nominal price.  Plus, I'll have a replacement battery when my original one begins to fail from use.  Order one, it's a great insurance policy.

It works great. It's compact and easy to use. No special plug needed. I debated on the desktop $T$ version but decided to use this since the compact version.

I bought the SD7500 series phone after the long wait between the CES announcement and the actual release.  While I have a couple of small gripes about the phones (quiet speakerphone, rounded base doesn't allow phone to stand on its own, cheaper than expected build $T$) the features of the system are outstanding.  The wireless camera works well (although it needs to be in relatively close range to the phone base station to work - had to relocate mine from where I wanted to have it).  This product - the bluetooth accessory, works perfectly and is a great way to access your cell phone calls when at home without having to keep a phone in your pocket all the time.

I finally found a phone that is designed for users, not geeks!  Every thing about the phone is intuitive so the manual really isn't necessary (as opposed to many things that I own that need a manual but do not ship with one).  The address book feature is easy to set up and use.  Other phones I have had in the past required me to remember a two digit number to recall an address book entry - this phone has a central list of names I can scroll to.  This address book is available to all phones on the system.  Also, there is a bluetooth connection to my cell phone so when I come home I simply put the cell phone near the base station and press the bluetooth button.  While I am home, if anyone calls my cell number, it rings through the system phones.  I can even dial out using the cell phone from any of the handsets in the house.  My only negative comment is that the voice $T$ seems a bit "tinny" at times but otherwise I think it is a very good product.

This product while not OEM works great for the LG 300G phone. If you lost your $T$, or like me end up doing a lot of last minute trips and need a second $T$ to keep in the to-go bag, this is the $T$ to get. The seller shipped the same day (Friday) I ordered, and it arrived on Monday three days ahead of estimated delivery. Decent quality, great price, and rapid delivery what else is there to say. Why pay $10 at the gas station for the same thing when you can get it on Amazon.com for less than half that!!

I'm sorry I cant give this product the 5 Stars I wanted to give it, when I received my $T$ thru the mail it came great, Brand New, Sealed in a plastic bag. At first it was all good and great, but after a couple of uses, I realized it was staying stuck on my phone and harder to take off, then one of the Grey buttons you press to take out the $T$ got stuck inside which only made things worse. The real mest up thing is that the broken Original $T$ that came with my phone Still Works, and that is even after i Crushed the lil' connecter with my Wheelchair, badly damaging the tip. Now you know how weak the New Charger I Bought was. But it's ok, its not like I paid $15.oo for it, Plus the trip to the Store, Plus the Tax Fee that is always added to every Store Purchase. So that's why I'm still Happy I bought it Here at Amazon.com :) it only cost me $5.oo or around that price, but still less than $10.oo with Shipping included so I will be buying one again to give it another try. :)Thank You Amazon.com and all the Sellers that make Buying Online Possible, Save me Alot of Money, And for Giving Me Credit! :)AND PLEASE DONT LET MY EXPIRIENCE AFFECT YOUR DECISION TO BUY or Not BUY HERE, I AM A QUADRIPLEGIC AND THEREFORE GRAB THINGS DIFFERENTLY THAN A NORMAL PERSON WOULD...

LG decided to use a one of a kind, super-skinny tip on the $T$ cable for the Tmobile G-slate and these DO NOT LAST in the real world. If they could have sold a few more of these tabs the could have made a killing on  selling $T$s like printer companies do on ink cartridges. Sad really because these are a really capable tab even now in 2014. But be aware that because of their design not because of flaws in manufacturing both the car $T$ and the home $T$ are really fragile. The only upside to this one is the right angle plug on the tip. If you buy the straight tip version you might as well use the 20 bucks to blow your nose and throw it in the trash. 'nuff said

I bought theMonster Mobile Ultra-Low Profile Vehicle Power Adapter for Motorola RAZR V3, A780, and Blackberrya while back and have been completely happy. After a recent trip with no power, I decided to track down a good $T$ for on the go. I ordered this based on my previous Monster experience. I am so glad I did.Why you ask? Simple.This $T$ is so freaking small. I had no idea and based on the pictures you won't either. The gold-plated charging "pins" disappear when you fold them into the adapter. Not only does it charge quickly, it's built like a tank and because of it's super-slim size, it fits anywhere.One of my best buys to date.

The product is offered at $ 0.01 cents - please do not even waste your money on this one. It takes more than 8 hours to charge my N95. Currently i am using 2 different aftermarket $T$s and they charge the phone in 1-2 hours of time. On top of this if somebody tries to refund this product the shipping cost will not be refunded. Therefore you only get back $ 0.01 cents. In todays practical world does somebody even have time to fight for $ 0.01? Maybe i was the only unlucky one but this will be my review for the product. Be very careful while buying aftermarket stuff (not only this $T$) and try to buy original manufacturer stuff if you can afford.

It did help me to determine that it was not the $T$ that was bad but that the connection inside the phone itself must be worn.  I am glad that the price was so reasonable that I could afford this test without spending a lot of hard earned money.  I really appreciate items such as this being available.

EXCELLENT SELLER!! Seller went above and beyond my expectations. The rating is on the product and not the seller. The $T$ and battery did not get the phone to work. I'll have to explore other options to try and retrieve my photos in the phone. Again...I want to praise this seller for her help. EXCELLENT SELLER!!

I use the Nokia 6555 as my travel phone, so the travel $T$ is very important to me. This one is more substantial than the one I got with the phone: less likely to kink or short out.Also charges more quickly than 2 other replacement $T$s I'd bought while traveling in South America. Both those also failed early on. So far so good with this one and for $3, including shipping, you can't go wrong.

My new Motorola RZAR came with a different $T$ than my previous RZAR that had a much better $T$. Cables were more flexible. The new $T$ failed and I needed a new one fast. Not only did I find the older original but also at a good price. Shipping was super fast so I wasn't out of commission at all. Amazon is a great place to shop for excellent selection of products at reasonable cost.

When you need extra charges (wall or auto) for your Blackberry, you can pay an arm and a leg at local electronics retailers or your cell phone carrier, or you can get exactly the same charge for a fraction of what they charge from Amazon. This $T$ is exactly the same "OEM" one that came with my Blackberry.

i bought this $T$ to use on my blackberry bold 9650 as a $T$ on my computer desk the original i use at my bedside i use this new $T$ with a desktop $T$ i also bought on amazon which i will review that also don't buy this without buying the desktop $T$.i had a blackberry curve and i was plugging in the $T$ on the side and 1 day the plug fell right inside the phone so i had no way to charge my phone. so i took my phone to the my repair store near me they told me they had never seen this happen before and would do nothing fpr me, so i had to pay $100 for a new phone thank god it was under warrenty or it would have $500. so when i found the desktop $T$ thats all i use now! the only time i use the side port is to connect the phone to my pc and thats it.so far i've had no issues with the $T$ it works great! for the money you cant go wrong it was cheap in price! great in quality so far if it fails i'll edit this post to let you know if it does!

Sorry, cell phone companies, but I don't feel privileged to buy accessories from your stores or websites when the items cost twice or thrice their value. This car charger for my new cell phone works perfectly, looks nicer and is so much more satisfying to buy at the low Amazon price than the overpriced version from the service provider.******UPDATE******Last week my car's radio circuit fuse blew. No radio, no accessories powered by either of my two accessory $T$s. After experimenting - and killing 5 fuses - turns out THIS item was the culprit. It fried internally somehow; maybe the tip touched just the right piece of metal or the heat in the car finally cooked it - who knows. What I do know is that I still wouldn't pay the inflated price for one of these at a cell company. But I also won't buy this brand again, either. I expect to receive more than 5-1/2 months service from an electronic accessory.

You need to provide your own usb cables, but that is ok since so many phones have different cables anyway.  The two phone I listed above have totally different connections.  Having the cords not included reduces the price anyways.

Scosche seems to be one of the few brands that offers a dual-port usb car charger that goes up to 3 amps combined (2+1). Personally I needed it to charge both my Galaxy Note 2 (up to 1.7 amps) and my wife's Galaxy S3 (up to 1 amp) while we are on road trips together. The Note 2 chugs a lot of power particularly when doing GPS navigation, audio playback, etc..., so on lower-powered chargers (i.e. 750 milli-amps) the rate of battery drain is faster than the rate of charge. Not good, but this model promises to remedy that. It is made for Galaxy/Android devices specifically (hence the name) as compared to the Apple-based variant of this charger, which is important to know for compatibility.My review of this product in a nutshell is: yes, it delivers a full 2 amps of power through one USB port. It's a little long in size, but reasonable. All connections seem to be snug. It's a very simple device: $T$ it in, and BYOC (bring your own cables) of any length. For those who want more detail, here it goes:I discovered 3 gotchas when purchasing a USB-based charger like this:1) Get the right version: Almost all devices will charge at up to 500 mA on any charger and in computer USB ports (but slowly). To see if the higher power draw is available, the device looks for a certain signal: In Apple products it is a resistance on the two data wires inside the cable. On Android it is a short on those same wires. In a nutshell: Apple-based devices will not charge at full power on Android-based chargers, and vice versa. This product is made specifically for Galaxy devices for this reason, and your mileage will vary elsewhere.If you want to convert an existing Apple charger to Android, you can either get out your soldering gun or try this device:Smart Adapter Compatible with Samsung Galaxy SI have not used it, but it claims to do that conversion.2) Device capabilities vary: For instance my wife's Galaxy S3 will only charge at up to ~1 amp in any device, no matter how much power I throw at it. If higher-power support is not there in the phone, you're out of luck. Unfortunately these limitations are not documented well, but it's a good bet to estimate using whatever milli-amp rating of the charger that comes with your device.3) Choose the right cable: If you do not have a thick, good quality cable for the length you are using, it will not charge at full speed and/or the power draw will fluctuate. Choose based on the advertised wire gauge number (AWG), with lower numbers being better/thicker.For 1 Amp Charging: 3' 28 AWG, 6' 24 AWG, 10' 22 AWG, 15' 20 AWGFor 2 Amp Charging: 3' 24 AWG, 6' 24 AWG, 10' 20 AWGThese numbers are based on an electrical equation, and I confirmed several of the data points with real-world testing. Note: The quality/design of the cable will introduce some variation, so these lengths/gauges are only an estimate.28 AWG - Standard for most cables when in doubt24 AWG -Monoprice 6ft Gold Plated(confirmed to do at least 1.7 amps)22 AWG - "Link Depot" makes this thicker variant of their normal cable, but it's not available on Amazon and hard to find20 AWG - "Arctic" makes these, but very hard to findPersonally I use a 3.5ft 24 AWG OEM Logitech USB cord that I got with a Harmony remote (not available on Amazon, search eBay for item 220831741556).I do not have a direct way to measure how much power is being drawn by this device, so I will compare with my observations of charging time using a wall charger. A 2 amp wall charger can charge my Note 2 to full in 2 hours while it is idle in standby (50%/hour). To put on maximum power drain, I ran the Stability Test v2.5 app (CPU+GPU stress test), played audio, ran navigation with GPS, and set screen brightness to full. This would normally drain my battery at 30%/hour. On this charger while in my vehicle and under load, my resulting charge was 20%/hour which is perfectly in line with expectations from a 2 amp charging device (50%-30%=+20% net charge). A "normal" load of nav, audio, and medium brightness was a drain of 20%/hour, and it likewise confirmed at net change of +30%/hour.So the charge rate is great: I can run everything to the limit and worst case it still will charge the phone in 5 hours. I'm very pleased with this device. It does what it is spec-ed for and with simplicity.

I received this today- been testing the charger in my car a couple of times and out of the 2.1 Amp USB socket I don't seem to be getting the full claimed 2.1 Amps- more like less than  1.33 Amps- (I test the charge rate by first $T$ging my device (Samsung Galaxy Note II) into its supplied AC wall charger that charges at a confirmed 2 amps and in 15 minutes the battery charge goes up by 12%- with the Scosche product in 15 minutes the battery charge  only rises 8%..)- still keeps the phone from losing charge when the GPS screen is on constantly (which is OK)- but only just-keeps the charge rate around the same level (not rising)- wanted a true 2 amp charge rate so I can use my GPS and still gain battery charge at the same time...

I have an LG Revolution which is what this charger is made for, but it doesn't work. It did work the first 2-3 times I used it, then it suddenly stopped working. I $T$ the phone in and it doesn't register that it's charging. I thought maybe it was charging, but just didn't show the battery building while $T$ged in, but my battery continued to drain even without using the phone as if it were not $T$ged in.

We lost the charger for my wife's LG Chocolate phone while traveling. The charger for my Motorola phone works with her LG, but it was inconvenient to try to juggle time for recharging. Also, Lithium cell phone batteries can start fires if not charged with the right voltage and current, so it makes sense to use the right charger. I'm leery of the cheap "universal" chargers, for this reason.Amazon had the exact OEM model charger at a good price. It's perfect for the job, and $T$ is great!

Ordered the adapter mainly based on price. I've looked at local electronics / cellular stores and the Verizon site since I bought the phone almost a year ago, never able to justify the high price or rude service for a gadget I expected to have to strong-arm into working.I was extremely pleased to get the cable about 4 days earlier than the earliest promised delivery date. Even more so when it just plugged in and started doing what was expected with no fuss or update required. Just connect to Hi-Def 42" Flat-screen and enjoy.Cable and adapter look to be good $T$, reasonably heavy duty so should last at least as long as I'll have the Phone. Now I just need to pick up aParrot AR.Drone 2.0 Quadricopter Controlled by iPod touch, iPhone, iPad, and Android Devices -Orange/Blueand get it's Hi-Def feed recording to have my techno Air Force up and running.Great experience - seller inquired immediately to confirm delivery and resolve any problems - auto-generated follow up no doubt, but still another sign of the over-all professionalism I experienced in the transaction.

And the reason is because I think I goofed by not confirming V and amps.  It looked exactly like what I needed, and even has LG on it (brand of my phone).  But it takes forever to charge my phone - much longer than the original $T$. So I looked at the fine print on the &#34;body&#34; of both $T$s and I see that the volt & amp numbers are slightly off.  But because the price was SO GOOD, I'm not going to return, it would cost as much to return.  So I will donate to Goodwill or something.  And I really like (and specifically looked for) the ability to disconnect for the USB connection so I can upload photos.  Very handy for travel!So the product itself is FINE.  The Amazon reseller was awesome as far as prompt service, product as described, etc.  Just word to the wise - read the print on your $T$ before you order another one.

There's definitely nothing about this product that warrants the selling price of $9.98 each--far, far from it. The casing looks and feels chintzy: even the little, circular, plastic, logo plaque is blurry and is stuck on the casing off-center; dirty, excess glue remains. I do want to point out, however, that the seller responded very promptly and exceptionally courteously to my complaint to Amazon about the low $T$, and that one cable was missing from the shipment (I ordered two).

I bought one of these like a year ago for (I think) around $1. I see that now it's selling for 1 cent (can't get much cheaper than that). My understanding is it's a generic product, so the quality is suspect. I personally haven't had any issues with mine, but it only gets light use since I'm not a heavy cell phone user, and I'm careful about wrapping the $T$ up and putting it away when I'm done charging my phone. If it gets heavy usage and/or rough treatment, I don't imagine it would hold up well, but, considering the price, I would say you can't go wrong with it if you need to replace a lost or broken original from your phone's manufacturer.

Does what it is supposed to do. No frills.One tip/idea/piece of advice: plug the $T$r in to the auto receptacle AFTER starting the vehicle. This will prevent power surges and blown fuses. It's a hard habit to break if you are in and out of the vehicle...but this will prevent possible frying of the $T$r and/or device being $T$d.

It works well with the headset, so I can keep it $T$d while on the road, and don't have to worry about running out of battery power

Feels very solid and works wonderfully. Slides into the cigarette lighter very easily unlike the one that actually came with my phone. The red led light is a bit bright but you can't miss it and you know the $T$r is working. Very please with it so far

My wife spends a lot of time in her car and needed this $T$r for the car. The Voyager Pro bluetooth works well and last long 5-6 hours. The car $T$r does the job we need as a back up.

This was purchased so that I could $T$ my Plantronics headset while in the truck. And it does that just fine. Has a red light so you know when it's on. Does it's job. I would buy from this seller again..

Bought this for my husband's Voyager PRO. He is a truck driver so this was much needed. While the $T$r worked great, the headset itself took a crap after 2 weeks. The company did not help whatsoever even though it was under warranty. So we ended up trashing it and buying a BlueParrot headset. Best decision we ever made.Charger: good for the 2 week durationHeadset: Didn't block sound as it was suppose to and just stopped workPlantronics customer service: HORRIBLE. THEY DO NOT HONOR THEIR WARRANTY.

Things did not go well with this purchase. I did not pay attention to the $T$r and unit to be $T$d not coming from the same seller. No biggie just a 1 cent and shipping lost.

I bought this car $T$r when the prongs on my regular $T$r broke and it seemed to work perfectly.  And it only cost me $5 including shipping.  Then the other day, it stopped working. My GPS $T$r worked fine, so it is not the outlets in my car. The red light on the part of the $T$r that plugs into the outlet does not light up, indicating no electricity is running through.

This $T$r looked like a bargain because of the price, but in both of our cars it blows a fuse in the car if you plug or unplug it from the cigarette lighter socket while the car is running.  The only way I can plug it in is when the car is turned off.  No other cigarette-lighter plug I've ever used in these cars has such a problem.

Phone seems to get much hotter when using this $T$r. A retractable one I bought recently does not heat up and the phone doesn't get hot like it did when connected to this $T$r. Also, the coiled cord does not uncoil very well or very far.

This is a good $T$r and it does work when you turn it a certain way in your car lighter. If you bump it a little it won't $T$ so you have to keep your eye on it and make sure the light stays on to let you know it's working

I had a hard time plugging this in to the car outlet...had to really jiggle and twist the upper part to get it to fit in properly and hold a $T$ (red light illuminates), but now it does what it is supposed to do with my LG Optimus Q, so hopefully the fit issues are resolved.

This product is OK. The connection plug is a little loose, so I have to make sure it positioned &#34;just so&#34; to $T$ my phone.

The tip connects to the $T$ securely, and to the phone.  Amazon's price was great.  I don't know what more I could want.

I have tried several cases on my wife's iPhone 3G and until this one none had satisfied both of us. She had originally bought a plain, white rubber case at the AT&T; store which she liked for its protectiveness, but I thought was ugly. I then tried a black, textured case which was more elegant, but she didn't like black. Then I tried a Gelaskin print of a Monet painting, but she did not like how the edges of her phone were exposed to wear, and how the children could pick at and remove the screen protector.  And now we come to this, which miraculously she likes.[Update: my wife moved up to a 3G S and the case fits that as well and shows no signs of wearing out.]What to like:The art$T$ is beautiful and might be of a Chinese mountain flower for which my wife is named: the Mei flower. Or at least, it's quite similar, and I like the little bees.The case is extremely protective with nothing exposed which need not be exposed. It seems likely that a phone kept in this case, with a screen protector in place will look like new. Which is a big thing for a device worth several hundred dollars that gets thrown around with keys.The edges of the screen protector are not exposed, keeping them from being picked at by naughty children.What not to like:The two pieces of the cover are just snapped together and held with a ring of plastic tabs which do not appear will take much stress before popping open, but of course, they are equally easily popped shut.The slight ridge around the touch screen can impede quick finger access to the edges of the display, but not horribly so, and only someone with the stubbiest of fingers would find pixels inaccessible.

I got this to keep my iphone safe from my klutziness. It $T$s although it does make my phone reasonably bigger. the scratch protect it came with does it job, it prevents scratches on your iphone but itself does scratch. the case cracked after i dropped it or tried to open it a couple times but it's stilldoing it's job. the included clip is to annoying to use because if you don't want it one there you must take everything apart and unscrew it.

This product was a perfect match for my phone,  I tried getting the part thru a phone store.  It was not available.  The phone tech did however tell me how to replace the part myself if I could find it. THANK YOU AMAZON .com !!!!I watched a video on u-tube that told me how to replace it. It seemed to complicated for someone who is not tech friendly. I did it the way the phone tech instructed me & it all $T$ed perfectly.Watching the u-tube video 5 times did give me the courage to try replacing it myself tho:-)The company suppling the part was Very!!! prompt I got my replacement part even before they estimated it would arrive.  Great service !! Would reccomend them to anyone needing parts. The price was so reasonable I bought two. That way I have one for backup.

I bought this glass lense hoping that it would last quite a while or until I got a new phone, it didn't. It $T$ed for the first couple of days, but then it broke as I was pushing on it to get an air bubble out. So if you want one for cheap, get it, but don't put it under any stress.

Exogear Exomount Universal Car Dash Mount (Fits All Smart Phones and Gps up to 5 Inches) WhiteExcellent, $T$s as advertised, mounts to most any surface, horizontal or vertical. If the pad get dirty, a little mild soap and water on your finger will clean it right up. Don't dry with any type of towel, it will stick to the pad and make a mess, trust me. First saw this reviewed on GeekBeat.TV. One may not be enough, and they make great gifts, this is a must have. Use anywhere, by land, air or sea and at home. Its uses are only limited by your imagination.

Inexpensive, secure & reliable, and easy to use. I was forever dropping my iPhone and I didn't like the bulky cases. This lanyard $T$s great. I just attach it, put it around my neck, slip the phone in my shirt pocket, and no more worries about damage.

It $T$s really well for me.  If I attach to the cord to my iphone & leave the string hanging our of my purse, the phone can easily be pulled to the top.  No need to dig to the bottom of the purse to make sure you have your phone or dig to the bottom to find your phone when it rings.The thing I like least is that the iphone is a little to heavy for me to hang the cord around my neck.

This lanyard $T$s well for what it is. I bought one for myself as a test before giving one to my mom as a gift. I tested it very thoroughly and there is no way that thing was coming loose. I actually ripped open the metal ring on the lanyard trying to pull it out of my iPhone before I realized there are squeeze-to-release buttons on the sides. My real issue was that it's just not comfortable to wear. The weight of the iPhone makes the strap uncomfortable around the neck, and the phone bounces around when you walk.

We have purchased two of these over about a month's time.  There is a small 3/8" ring that connects the dock connector to the lanyard.  That is the weak point of this unit and makes it ineffective to last very long.  A lanyard hanging around your neck keeps the phone or iPod from dropping -- good enough -- but it also gets tugged one once in a while.  This small ring has no strength and gives way.  On the second unit we bought, I replaced that weak point with the smallest spring steel keyring I could find.  After this modification, we have what it should have been in the first place.  It is now durable enough to last indefinitely.  Please note, this unit will not $T$ at all with the newer Apple products using the lightening connector -- but will $T$ with most portable Apple devices made in the previous 9 years, or so.  BUT be ready and expect to make the same modification to it that I did.
